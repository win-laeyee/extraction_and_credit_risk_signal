[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "date": "Jun 11, 2024,02:15pm EDT",
        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks is the band's first project to spend two full years on the U.K. albums chart, as of this week. (Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they\u2019ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

Justin Gill, Bachan\u2019s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that\u2019s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. \u201cI wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,\u201d says Gill, \u201cOne that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.\u201d The mass appeal of Bachan\u2019s is one of many reasons why Gill\u2019s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan\u2019s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan\u2019s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan\u2019s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan\u2019s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan\u2019s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells.

Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. \u201cI bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,\u201d Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan\u2019s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is \u201ctotally self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,\u201d says Gill. \u201cBut A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.\u201d Gill\u2019s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill\u2019s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill\u2019s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family\u2019s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. \u201cI wanted to do something I love,\u201d Gill recalls, \u201cand really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.\u201d It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. \u201cI really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we\u2019d have something totally different,\u201d says Gill. \u201cAnd if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.\u201d The 10 ingredients Bachan\u2019s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality\u2014certainly more premium than what Gill\u2019s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan\u2019s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan\u2019s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year\u2014from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan\u2019s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d says Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan\u2019s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends\u2014one for $100,000 was tied to his home\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan\u2019s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan\u2019s\u2014to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there\u2019s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan\u2019s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan\u2019s became the top seller in the grocer\u2019s barbecue sauce aisle. \u201cIt can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It\u2019s really regionally driven,\u201d says Whole Foods\u2019 Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. \u201cWhat's exciting about Bachan\u2019s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce\u2014but in a totally different way.\u201d In 2021, Gill raised Bachan\u2019s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon\u2019s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. \u201cIt was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,\u201d says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude\u2019s managing partner and cofounder. \u201cBut it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.\u201d It was Gill\u2019s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan\u2019s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan\u2019s, which Sonoma\u2019s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been \u201cjust mind-blowing to me as an investor.\u201d \u201cIt's a Sriracha 2.0,\u201d Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. \u201cSriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan\u2019s in the same way.\u201d That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America\u2019s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan\u2019s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan\u2019s even got mentioned by Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan\u2019s as an example of how he\u2019s \u201cpersonally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\u201d Bachan\u2019s has \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d adds Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan\u2019s has \u201cperformed very well and grown share.\u201d After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan\u2019s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he\u2019s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and \u201cgoing deeper\u201d in the category. As awareness of Bachan\u2019s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. \u201cWe want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,\u201d says Gill. \u201cI want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.\u201d",

        "date": "Jul 16, 2024,08:49am EDT",
        "author": "Adam A. Millsap",
        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

        "content": "Rhea Ripley returned to WWE Raw with a fiery promo to open the show. WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley\u2019s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week\u2019s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre\u2019s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

        "content": "Chris Sale, an eight-time All-Star, leads the majors with 13 victories this season. During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard\u2019s chart that focuses specifically on what\u2019s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit\u2013one that\u2019s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash \u201cThunderstruck\u201d on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units\u2013in this country alone, that is.",

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump\u2019s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O\u2019Brien also called out the GOP\u2019s \u201cactive opposition\u201d to labor unions and said, \u201cthis too must change.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he\u2019ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

(UPDATE: Trump has chosen J.D. Vance\u2014read more here.) Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the SNHU Arena on January 20, 2024 ... [+] in Manchester, New Hampshire. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump\u2019s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump\u2019s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump\u2019s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

[+] Rasananda resort  June 18, 2012 on the island of Koh Phangan off the coast of Koh Samui . Thailand's official tourism body, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set itself the ambitious target of attracting more than 20 million tourists in 2012. According to TAT, In April, Thailand welcomed 1,659,021 international tourists which is a slight increase of 6.87% over the same in 2011.  (Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.",

        "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer\u2019s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. \u201cThe national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,\u201d the account Awful Announcing penned on X. \u201cIt is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,\u201d added another X user. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I\u2019ve ever heard in my whole life,\u201d wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie\u2019s infamous live version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. \u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 was not good. I\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re all thinking it and it has to be said,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

The 32-year-old found success with her 2019 breakthrough hit \u201cMore Hearts Than Mine\u201d and albums Good Person and Lady Like. She was nominated for four Grammys, including Best New Artist, Best Country Song, and Best Country Album in 2021. In 2023, her track with Sam Hunt titled \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d was a contender for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. According to CBS Sports, Andress\u2019 father, Brad Andress, was a strength and conditioning coach with the Detroit Tigers, Colorado Rockies, New York Mets, and the University of Michigan.",

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer. Mikel Oyarzabal #11 celebrates with Pedri Gonzalez #16 of Team Spain after scoring a goal during the ... [+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

        "content": "Kim Seon-ho plays the director of a secret agency in 'The Tyrant.' Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.\u201d The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "title": "For Boeing, Buying Spirit Is Only The Start Of Solving Its Problems",
        "date": "Jul 1, 2024,06:00pm EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club\u2019s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino P\u00e9rez and all 15 of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League trophies, Mbapp\u00e9 received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club\u2019s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. \u201812 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u2019 P\u00e9rez said to introduce the player. \u2018Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East.

Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ... [+] after leaving the game in the bottom of the eighth inning against the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on July 09, 2024 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) This season, Kikuchi has made 20 starts, and he\u2019s thrown 117 innings. He has pitched to a 4.42 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - JUNE 24: Chris Bassitt #40 of the Toronto Blue Jays pitches against the ... [+] Boston Red Sox during the first inning at Fenway Park on June 24, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images) Bassitt signed a three-year, $63 million contract in 2023. He will have to be paid the remainder of $22 million this year, and all of $22 million in 2025. Bassitt has a record of 8-7 in 19 starts, covering 107.1 innings. He has struck out an average of 8.4 hitters per nine innings, while walking 3.8. He has yielded eight home runs. Assessment: Inconsistent, but among the better potential starting pitchers on the trade market. TORONTO, ON- JUNE 19  -  Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman (34) as the Toronto Blue Jays fall ... [+] to the Boston Red Sox 7-3 at Rogers Centre in Toronto. June 19, 2024.  Steve Russell/Toronto Star        (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Gausman is working on a five-year, $110 million contract he signed in 2022. He has the remainder of $22 million for this year, and two years at $23 million left on his contract. Gausman has a record of 7-8 in 19 starts covering 104 innings. He has a 4.5 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Gausman is striking out an average of 9 hitters per game, walking 2.3. He has yielded 15 home runs. Assessment-Inconsistency risk, but of value to contending teams.

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) Rodriguez signed a five-year, $32 million contract in 2024. There are player and team options in his deal, but his contract has an average annual value of $6.4 million. Rodriguez has made just eight starts. He has a record of 1-3 in 33.1 innings. His ERA is 3.78, and his WHIP is 1.38. He has struck out an average of 9.75, while walking 4.9 per nine innings. He has yielded three home runs. Assessment: To this scout, Rodriguez is the least likely to be traded.",

        "title": "Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points",
        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

        "date": "Jul 16, 2024,05:31am EDT",
        "author": "Morten Stig Jensen",
        "content": "Frederik Drejer Erichsen driving towards the basket during NBA Academy play. In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told \u201cThe Download\u201d podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release \u201cVultures 2\u201d on May 3\u2014nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album\u2019s alleged release\u2014West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted \u201cVultures 2 en route\u201d on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West\u2019s fans on social media are anticipating the album won\u2019t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song \u201cTalking,\u201d a cut from \u201cVultures 1,\u201d and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin\u2019s \u201cLike That\u201d to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar\u2014but neither seem to have anything to do with \u201cVultures 2.\u201d West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for \u201cVultures 1,\u201d his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn\u2019t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his \u201cVultures\u201d trilogy would release March 8 and April 5\u2014but he\u2019s since missed both of these deadlines. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer\u2019s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, \u201cI Feel Love,\u201d after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was West\u2019s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put \u201cVultures 2\u201d on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming \u201cdevalues music.\u201d According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How \u201cVultures 2\u201d will fare on the charts. \u201cVultures 1\u201d previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single \u201cCarnival\u201d went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold \u201cVultures 2\u201d from streaming services, the album\u2019s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, \u201cVultures 2\u201d would face chart competition from Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cRadical Optimism,\u201d also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

        "content": "More than 1,000 protesters across the country have been arrested at pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses over the course of the last week, including many students and faculty members, as universities and city police departments expand a controversial crackdown on a protest movement calling for divestment from Israel. The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University\u2019s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University\u2019s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported. May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported\u201410 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school\u2019s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University\u2019s encampment, the college\u2019s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane\u2019s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an \u201cunlawful occupation.\u201d May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona\u2019s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with \u201caggravated assault against a peace officer,\u201d the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University\u2019s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated \u201c40 to 50\u201d who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York\u2019s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University\u2019s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment\u2014although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would \u201cnot bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\u201d April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University\u2019s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members\u2014leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump appears during the Republican ... [+] National Convention Monday, July 15, 2024, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race.

        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

They have a clear vision of the potential impacts of policy changes and market trends on the energy sector. Their analysis of the delayed energy transition scenario indicates a comprehensive understanding of the complexities of the energy market. However, the uncertainty in the energy transition and potential policy changes could pose some risks to the company. Despite this, their expertise and understanding of the market dynamics should enable them to navigate these challenges effectively."

[+] photocall at the Rolling Stones \"Hackney Diamonds\" Launch Event at Hackney Empire on September 06, 2023 in London, England. The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks is the band's first project to spend two full years on the U.K. albums chart, as of this week. (Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they\u2019ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

        "content": "Rhea Ripley returned to WWE Raw with a fiery promo to open the show. WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley\u2019s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week\u2019s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre\u2019s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard\u2019s chart that focuses specifically on what\u2019s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit\u2013one that\u2019s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash \u201cThunderstruck\u201d on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor.

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

        "content": "Neighbors of the man the FBI has said carried out an attempted assassination against Donald Trump said signs in support of the former president have periodically appeared outside the Bethel Park, Pa. home of Thomas Matthew Crooks over the last several years, local news outlets reported. Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump\u2019s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O\u2019Brien also called out the GOP\u2019s \u201cactive opposition\u201d to labor unions and said, \u201cthis too must change.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he\u2019ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

(UPDATE: Trump has chosen J.D. Vance\u2014read more here.) Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the SNHU Arena on January 20, 2024 ... [+] in Manchester, New Hampshire. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump\u2019s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump\u2019s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump\u2019s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

        "date": "Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT",
        "author": "Matt Craig",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer\u2019s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. \u201cThe national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,\u201d the account Awful Announcing penned on X. \u201cIt is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,\u201d added another X user. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I\u2019ve ever heard in my whole life,\u201d wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie\u2019s infamous live version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. \u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 was not good. I\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re all thinking it and it has to be said,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

The 32-year-old found success with her 2019 breakthrough hit \u201cMore Hearts Than Mine\u201d and albums Good Person and Lady Like. She was nominated for four Grammys, including Best New Artist, Best Country Song, and Best Country Album in 2021. In 2023, her track with Sam Hunt titled \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d was a contender for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. According to CBS Sports, Andress\u2019 father, Brad Andress, was a strength and conditioning coach with the Detroit Tigers, Colorado Rockies, New York Mets, and the University of Michigan.",

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer. Mikel Oyarzabal #11 celebrates with Pedri Gonzalez #16 of Team Spain after scoring a goal during the ... [+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

        "content": "Kim Seon-ho plays the director of a secret agency in 'The Tyrant.' Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.\u201d The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club\u2019s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino P\u00e9rez and all 15 of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League trophies, Mbapp\u00e9 received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club\u2019s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. \u201812 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u2019 P\u00e9rez said to introduce the player. \u2018Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

        "content": "House of the Dragon vs Game of Thrones If you asked me who my favorite character in Game Of Thrones was, I\u2019d have a really hard time answering simply because there are far too many to choose from. I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO\u2019s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I\u2019d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don\u2019t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She\u2019s noble and kind for the most part. But she\u2019s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard\u2019s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father\u2019s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King\u2019s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark\u2019s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they\u2019re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that\u2019s really missing\u2014the thing that you can\u2019t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you\u2019re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones\u2014is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I\u2019m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he\u2019s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren\u2019t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters\u2014Tyrion perhaps most of all\u2014are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we\u2019ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There\u2019s always a smirk on Aemond\u2019s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon\u2019s eyes, but you\u2019ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what\u2019s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven\u2019t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn\u2019t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are \u201cabout as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.\u201d If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.\u201d",

Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ... [+] after leaving the game in the bottom of the eighth inning against the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on July 09, 2024 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) This season, Kikuchi has made 20 starts, and he\u2019s thrown 117 innings. He has pitched to a 4.42 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

[+] Boston Red Sox during the first inning at Fenway Park on June 24, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images) Bassitt signed a three-year, $63 million contract in 2023. He will have to be paid the remainder of $22 million this year, and all of $22 million in 2025. Bassitt has a record of 8-7 in 19 starts, covering 107.1 innings. He has struck out an average of 8.4 hitters per nine innings, while walking 3.8. He has yielded eight home runs. Assessment: Inconsistent, but among the better potential starting pitchers on the trade market. TORONTO, ON- JUNE 19  -  Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman (34) as the Toronto Blue Jays fall ...

He has the remainder of $22 million for this year, and two years at $23 million left on his contract. Gausman has a record of 7-8 in 19 starts covering 104 innings. He has a 4.5 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Gausman is striking out an average of 9 hitters per game, walking 2.3. He has yielded 15 home runs. Assessment-Inconsistency risk, but of value to contending teams.

There are player and team options in his deal, but his contract has an average annual value of $6.4 million. Rodriguez has made just eight starts. He has a record of 1-3 in 33.1 innings. His ERA is 3.78, and his WHIP is 1.38. He has struck out an average of 9.75, while walking 4.9 per nine innings. He has yielded three home runs. Assessment: To this scout, Rodriguez is the least likely to be traded.",

        "title": "Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points",
        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

        "title": "Danish Basketball Is Making Moves, Starting With The NBA Academy Games",
        "date": "Jul 16, 2024,05:31am EDT",
        "author": "Morten Stig Jensen",
        "content": "Frederik Drejer Erichsen driving towards the basket during NBA Academy play. In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told \u201cThe Download\u201d podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release \u201cVultures 2\u201d on May 3\u2014nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album\u2019s alleged release\u2014West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted \u201cVultures 2 en route\u201d on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West\u2019s fans on social media are anticipating the album won\u2019t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song \u201cTalking,\u201d a cut from \u201cVultures 1,\u201d and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin\u2019s \u201cLike That\u201d to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar\u2014but neither seem to have anything to do with \u201cVultures 2.\u201d West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for \u201cVultures 1,\u201d his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn\u2019t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his \u201cVultures\u201d trilogy would release March 8 and April 5\u2014but he\u2019s since missed both of these deadlines. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer\u2019s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, \u201cI Feel Love,\u201d after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was West\u2019s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put \u201cVultures 2\u201d on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming \u201cdevalues music.\u201d According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How \u201cVultures 2\u201d will fare on the charts. \u201cVultures 1\u201d previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single \u201cCarnival\u201d went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold \u201cVultures 2\u201d from streaming services, the album\u2019s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, \u201cVultures 2\u201d would face chart competition from Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cRadical Optimism,\u201d also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

        "content": "More than 1,000 protesters across the country have been arrested at pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses over the course of the last week, including many students and faculty members, as universities and city police departments expand a controversial crackdown on a protest movement calling for divestment from Israel. The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University\u2019s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University\u2019s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported. May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported\u201410 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school\u2019s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University\u2019s encampment, the college\u2019s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane\u2019s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an \u201cunlawful occupation.\u201d May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona\u2019s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with \u201caggravated assault against a peace officer,\u201d the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University\u2019s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated \u201c40 to 50\u201d who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York\u2019s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University\u2019s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment\u2014although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would \u201cnot bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\u201d April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University\u2019s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members\u2014leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "date": "Jun 11, 2024,02:15pm EDT",
        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

[+] photocall at the Rolling Stones \"Hackney Diamonds\" Launch Event at Hackney Empire on September 06, 2023 in London, England. The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks is the band's first project to spend two full years on the U.K. albums chart, as of this week. (Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they\u2019ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

        "content": "From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan\u2019s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan\u2019s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that\u2019s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. \u201cI wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,\u201d says Gill, \u201cOne that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.\u201d The mass appeal of Bachan\u2019s is one of many reasons why Gill\u2019s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan\u2019s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan\u2019s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan\u2019s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan\u2019s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan\u2019s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce\u2014in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. \u201cI bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,\u201d Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan\u2019s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is \u201ctotally self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,\u201d says Gill. \u201cBut A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.\u201d Gill\u2019s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill\u2019s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill\u2019s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family\u2019s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. \u201cI wanted to do something I love,\u201d Gill recalls, \u201cand really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.\u201d It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. \u201cI really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we\u2019d have something totally different,\u201d says Gill. \u201cAnd if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.\u201d The 10 ingredients Bachan\u2019s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality\u2014certainly more premium than what Gill\u2019s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan\u2019s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan\u2019s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year\u2014from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan\u2019s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d says Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan\u2019s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends\u2014one for $100,000 was tied to his home\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan\u2019s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan\u2019s\u2014to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there\u2019s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan\u2019s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan\u2019s became the top seller in the grocer\u2019s barbecue sauce aisle. \u201cIt can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It\u2019s really regionally driven,\u201d says Whole Foods\u2019 Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. \u201cWhat's exciting about Bachan\u2019s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce\u2014but in a totally different way.\u201d In 2021, Gill raised Bachan\u2019s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon\u2019s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. \u201cIt was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,\u201d says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude\u2019s managing partner and cofounder. \u201cBut it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.\u201d It was Gill\u2019s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan\u2019s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan\u2019s, which Sonoma\u2019s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been \u201cjust mind-blowing to me as an investor.\u201d \u201cIt's a Sriracha 2.0,\u201d Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. \u201cSriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan\u2019s in the same way.\u201d That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America\u2019s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan\u2019s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan\u2019s even got mentioned by Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan\u2019s as an example of how he\u2019s \u201cpersonally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\u201d Bachan\u2019s has \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d adds Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan\u2019s has \u201cperformed very well and grown share.\u201d After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan\u2019s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he\u2019s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and \u201cgoing deeper\u201d in the category. As awareness of Bachan\u2019s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. \u201cWe want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,\u201d says Gill. \u201cI want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.\u201d",

        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

        "content": "Chris Sale, an eight-time All-Star, leads the majors with 13 victories this season. During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard\u2019s chart that focuses specifically on what\u2019s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit\u2013one that\u2019s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash \u201cThunderstruck\u201d on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor.

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

Major donors to the campaign include Musk ($100,000); Griffin ($100,000); billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn ($50,000); Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his wife, Ann ($50,000); the conservative Heritage Foundation ($50,000); UFC President Dana White ($50,000); Kid Rock ($50,000); former Republican presidential nomination contender Vivek Ramaswamy ($30,000); Ben Shapiro ($15,000) and the conservative news website Shapiro founded, the Daily Wire ($15,000). The fundraising page claims to have been authorized by Trump and will support those wounded or killed in Saturday's \"brutal and horrific assassination attempt.\"Griffin on Sunday called the attempted assassination of Trump a \"tragic and disturbing day in America\" and denounced political violence, calling Americans \"fortunate to have the right to peacefully resolve our political differences by casting our votes.\u201d Griffin, the founder of the Miami-based hedge fund firm Citadel, has donated to conservative causes and candidates in the past, including Trump\u2019s chief 2024 primary rival former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but has so far refrained from donating to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. In May, he said he was waiting to see who Trump chooses to run as his vice presidential running mate before deciding whether to donate (Trump on Monday announced Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate). Representatives for Griffin Catalyst, the philanthropic civic engagement initiative founded by Griffin last year, did not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment Monday.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

        "content": "Neighbors of the man the FBI has said carried out an attempted assassination against Donald Trump said signs in support of the former president have periodically appeared outside the Bethel Park, Pa. home of Thomas Matthew Crooks over the last several years, local news outlets reported. Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump\u2019s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O\u2019Brien also called out the GOP\u2019s \u201cactive opposition\u201d to labor unions and said, \u201cthis too must change.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he\u2019ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump\u2019s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump\u2019s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump\u2019s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

[+] Rasananda resort  June 18, 2012 on the island of Koh Phangan off the coast of Koh Samui . Thailand's official tourism body, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set itself the ambitious target of attracting more than 20 million tourists in 2012. According to TAT, In April, Thailand welcomed 1,659,021 international tourists which is a slight increase of 6.87% over the same in 2011.  (Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.",

The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. \u201cThe national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,\u201d the account Awful Announcing penned on X. \u201cIt is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,\u201d added another X user. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I\u2019ve ever heard in my whole life,\u201d wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie\u2019s infamous live version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. \u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 was not good. I\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re all thinking it and it has to be said,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

She was nominated for four Grammys, including Best New Artist, Best Country Song, and Best Country Album in 2021. In 2023, her track with Sam Hunt titled \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d was a contender for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer. Mikel Oyarzabal #11 celebrates with Pedri Gonzalez #16 of Team Spain after scoring a goal during the ... [+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

        "content": "Kim Seon-ho plays the director of a secret agency in 'The Tyrant.' Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.\u201d The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "title": "For Boeing, Buying Spirit Is Only The Start Of Solving Its Problems",
        "date": "Jul 1, 2024,06:00pm EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

        "content": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was presented as a new Real Madrid signing. The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club\u2019s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino P\u00e9rez and all 15 of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League trophies, Mbapp\u00e9 received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club\u2019s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. \u201812 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u2019 P\u00e9rez said to introduce the player. \u2018Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

        "content": "House of the Dragon vs Game of Thrones If you asked me who my favorite character in Game Of Thrones was, I\u2019d have a really hard time answering simply because there are far too many to choose from. I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO\u2019s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I\u2019d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don\u2019t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She\u2019s noble and kind for the most part. But she\u2019s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard\u2019s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father\u2019s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King\u2019s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark\u2019s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they\u2019re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that\u2019s really missing\u2014the thing that you can\u2019t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you\u2019re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones\u2014is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I\u2019m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he\u2019s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren\u2019t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters\u2014Tyrion perhaps most of all\u2014are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we\u2019ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There\u2019s always a smirk on Aemond\u2019s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon\u2019s eyes, but you\u2019ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what\u2019s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven\u2019t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn\u2019t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are \u201cabout as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.\u201d If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.\u201d",

        "content": "TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. #27 of Toronto Blue Jays smiles as he comes off the ... [+] field in a break in play against the Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don\u2019t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball\u2019s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ... [+] after leaving the game in the bottom of the eighth inning against the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on July 09, 2024 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) This season, Kikuchi has made 20 starts, and he\u2019s thrown 117 innings. He has pitched to a 4.42 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - JUNE 24: Chris Bassitt #40 of the Toronto Blue Jays pitches against the ... [+] Boston Red Sox during the first inning at Fenway Park on June 24, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images) Bassitt signed a three-year, $63 million contract in 2023. He will have to be paid the remainder of $22 million this year, and all of $22 million in 2025. Bassitt has a record of 8-7 in 19 starts, covering 107.1 innings. He has struck out an average of 8.4 hitters per nine innings, while walking 3.8. He has yielded eight home runs. Assessment: Inconsistent, but among the better potential starting pitchers on the trade market. TORONTO, ON- JUNE 19  -  Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman (34) as the Toronto Blue Jays fall ... [+] to the Boston Red Sox 7-3 at Rogers Centre in Toronto. June 19, 2024.  Steve Russell/Toronto Star        (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Gausman is working on a five-year, $110 million contract he signed in 2022. He has the remainder of $22 million for this year, and two years at $23 million left on his contract. Gausman has a record of 7-8 in 19 starts covering 104 innings. He has a 4.5 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Gausman is striking out an average of 9 hitters per game, walking 2.3. He has yielded 15 home runs. Assessment-Inconsistency risk, but of value to contending teams.

[+] Houston Astros during the seventh inning in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 1, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) Rodriguez signed a five-year, $32 million contract in 2024. There are player and team options in his deal, but his contract has an average annual value of $6.4 million. Rodriguez has made just eight starts. He has a record of 1-3 in 33.1 innings. His ERA is 3.78, and his WHIP is 1.38. He has struck out an average of 9.75, while walking 4.9 per nine innings. He has yielded three home runs. Assessment: To this scout, Rodriguez is the least likely to be traded.",

        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported\u201410 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school\u2019s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University\u2019s encampment, the college\u2019s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane\u2019s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an \u201cunlawful occupation.\u201d May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona\u2019s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with \u201caggravated assault against a peace officer,\u201d the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported.

April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University\u2019s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated \u201c40 to 50\u201d who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York\u2019s campus in Harlem the same night.

Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

[+] photocall at the Rolling Stones \"Hackney Diamonds\" Launch Event at Hackney Empire on September 06, 2023 in London, England. The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks is the band's first project to spend two full years on the U.K. albums chart, as of this week. (Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they\u2019ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

        "author": "Chloe Sorvino",
        "content": "From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan\u2019s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan\u2019s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that\u2019s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. \u201cI wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,\u201d says Gill, \u201cOne that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.\u201d The mass appeal of Bachan\u2019s is one of many reasons why Gill\u2019s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan\u2019s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan\u2019s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan\u2019s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan\u2019s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan\u2019s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce\u2014in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. \u201cI bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,\u201d Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan\u2019s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is \u201ctotally self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,\u201d says Gill. \u201cBut A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.\u201d Gill\u2019s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill\u2019s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill\u2019s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family\u2019s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. \u201cI wanted to do something I love,\u201d Gill recalls, \u201cand really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.\u201d It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. \u201cI really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we\u2019d have something totally different,\u201d says Gill. \u201cAnd if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.\u201d The 10 ingredients Bachan\u2019s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality\u2014certainly more premium than what Gill\u2019s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan\u2019s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan\u2019s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year\u2014from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan\u2019s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d says Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan\u2019s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends\u2014one for $100,000 was tied to his home\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan\u2019s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan\u2019s\u2014to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there\u2019s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan\u2019s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan\u2019s became the top seller in the grocer\u2019s barbecue sauce aisle. \u201cIt can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It\u2019s really regionally driven,\u201d says Whole Foods\u2019 Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. \u201cWhat's exciting about Bachan\u2019s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce\u2014but in a totally different way.\u201d In 2021, Gill raised Bachan\u2019s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon\u2019s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. \u201cIt was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,\u201d says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude\u2019s managing partner and cofounder. \u201cBut it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.\u201d It was Gill\u2019s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan\u2019s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan\u2019s, which Sonoma\u2019s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been \u201cjust mind-blowing to me as an investor.\u201d \u201cIt's a Sriracha 2.0,\u201d Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. \u201cSriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan\u2019s in the same way.\u201d That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America\u2019s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan\u2019s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan\u2019s even got mentioned by Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan\u2019s as an example of how he\u2019s \u201cpersonally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\u201d Bachan\u2019s has \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d adds Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan\u2019s has \u201cperformed very well and grown share.\u201d After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan\u2019s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he\u2019s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and \u201cgoing deeper\u201d in the category. As awareness of Bachan\u2019s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. \u201cWe want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,\u201d says Gill. \u201cI want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.\u201d",

        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

        "content": "Rhea Ripley returned to WWE Raw with a fiery promo to open the show. WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley\u2019s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week\u2019s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre\u2019s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

        "content": "Chris Sale, an eight-time All-Star, leads the majors with 13 victories this season. During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well.

AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash \u201cThunderstruck\u201d on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor.

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

        "content": "Neighbors of the man the FBI has said carried out an attempted assassination against Donald Trump said signs in support of the former president have periodically appeared outside the Bethel Park, Pa. home of Thomas Matthew Crooks over the last several years, local news outlets reported. Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump\u2019s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O\u2019Brien also called out the GOP\u2019s \u201cactive opposition\u201d to labor unions and said, \u201cthis too must change.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he\u2019ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump will reportedly announce his running mate Monday afternoon as the Republican National Convention kicks off just two days after the former president was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. (UPDATE: Trump has chosen J.D. Vance\u2014read more here.) Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the SNHU Arena on January 20, 2024 ... [+] in Manchester, New Hampshire. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump\u2019s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump\u2019s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump\u2019s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

[+] Rasananda resort  June 18, 2012 on the island of Koh Phangan off the coast of Koh Samui . Thailand's official tourism body, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set itself the ambitious target of attracting more than 20 million tourists in 2012. According to TAT, In April, Thailand welcomed 1,659,021 international tourists which is a slight increase of 6.87% over the same in 2011.  (Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.",

        "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer\u2019s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. \u201cThe national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,\u201d the account Awful Announcing penned on X. \u201cIt is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,\u201d added another X user. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I\u2019ve ever heard in my whole life,\u201d wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie\u2019s infamous live version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. \u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 was not good. I\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re all thinking it and it has to be said,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

[+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

        "content": "Kim Seon-ho plays the director of a secret agency in 'The Tyrant.' Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.\u201d The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "date": "Jul 1, 2024,06:00pm EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

        "content": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was presented as a new Real Madrid signing. The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club\u2019s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino P\u00e9rez and all 15 of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League trophies, Mbapp\u00e9 received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club\u2019s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. \u201812 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u2019 P\u00e9rez said to introduce the player. \u2018Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

The club's ability to attract such a player indicates a strong financial position.

The club's ability to fill its stadium for the player's presentation also indicates a strong fan base, which can translate into consistent revenue.

        "author": "Erik Kain",
        "content": "House of the Dragon vs Game of Thrones If you asked me who my favorite character in Game Of Thrones was, I\u2019d have a really hard time answering simply because there are far too many to choose from. I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO\u2019s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I\u2019d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don\u2019t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She\u2019s noble and kind for the most part. But she\u2019s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard\u2019s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father\u2019s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King\u2019s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark\u2019s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they\u2019re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that\u2019s really missing\u2014the thing that you can\u2019t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you\u2019re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones\u2014is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I\u2019m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he\u2019s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren\u2019t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters\u2014Tyrion perhaps most of all\u2014are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we\u2019ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There\u2019s always a smirk on Aemond\u2019s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon\u2019s eyes, but you\u2019ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what\u2019s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven\u2019t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn\u2019t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are \u201cabout as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.\u201d If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.\u201d",

[+] field in a break in play against the Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don\u2019t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball\u2019s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices.

Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

        "title": "Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points",
        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

        "date": "Jul 16, 2024,05:31am EDT",
        "author": "Morten Stig Jensen",
        "content": "Frederik Drejer Erichsen driving towards the basket during NBA Academy play. In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told \u201cThe Download\u201d podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release \u201cVultures 2\u201d on May 3\u2014nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album\u2019s alleged release\u2014West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted \u201cVultures 2 en route\u201d on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West\u2019s fans on social media are anticipating the album won\u2019t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song \u201cTalking,\u201d a cut from \u201cVultures 1,\u201d and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin\u2019s \u201cLike That\u201d to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar\u2014but neither seem to have anything to do with \u201cVultures 2.\u201d West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for \u201cVultures 1,\u201d his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn\u2019t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his \u201cVultures\u201d trilogy would release March 8 and April 5\u2014but he\u2019s since missed both of these deadlines. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer\u2019s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, \u201cI Feel Love,\u201d after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. \u201cVultures 1\u201d was West\u2019s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put \u201cVultures 2\u201d on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming \u201cdevalues music.\u201d According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How \u201cVultures 2\u201d will fare on the charts. \u201cVultures 1\u201d previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single \u201cCarnival\u201d went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold \u201cVultures 2\u201d from streaming services, the album\u2019s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, \u201cVultures 2\u201d would face chart competition from Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cRadical Optimism,\u201d also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University\u2019s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated \u201c40 to 50\u201d who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York\u2019s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University\u2019s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment\u2014although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would \u201cnot bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\u201d April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University\u2019s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members\u2014leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

        "content": "From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan\u2019s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan\u2019s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that\u2019s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. \u201cI wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,\u201d says Gill, \u201cOne that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.\u201d The mass appeal of Bachan\u2019s is one of many reasons why Gill\u2019s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan\u2019s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan\u2019s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan\u2019s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan\u2019s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan\u2019s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce\u2014in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. \u201cI bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,\u201d Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan\u2019s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is \u201ctotally self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,\u201d says Gill. \u201cBut A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.\u201d Gill\u2019s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill\u2019s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill\u2019s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family\u2019s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. \u201cI wanted to do something I love,\u201d Gill recalls, \u201cand really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.\u201d It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. \u201cI really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we\u2019d have something totally different,\u201d says Gill. \u201cAnd if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.\u201d The 10 ingredients Bachan\u2019s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality\u2014certainly more premium than what Gill\u2019s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan\u2019s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan\u2019s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year\u2014from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan\u2019s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d says Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan\u2019s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends\u2014one for $100,000 was tied to his home\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan\u2019s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan\u2019s\u2014to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there\u2019s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan\u2019s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan\u2019s became the top seller in the grocer\u2019s barbecue sauce aisle. \u201cIt can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It\u2019s really regionally driven,\u201d says Whole Foods\u2019 Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. \u201cWhat's exciting about Bachan\u2019s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce\u2014but in a totally different way.\u201d In 2021, Gill raised Bachan\u2019s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon\u2019s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. \u201cIt was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,\u201d says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude\u2019s managing partner and cofounder. \u201cBut it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.\u201d It was Gill\u2019s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan\u2019s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan\u2019s, which Sonoma\u2019s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been \u201cjust mind-blowing to me as an investor.\u201d \u201cIt's a Sriracha 2.0,\u201d Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. \u201cSriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan\u2019s in the same way.\u201d That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America\u2019s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan\u2019s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan\u2019s even got mentioned by Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan\u2019s as an example of how he\u2019s \u201cpersonally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\u201d Bachan\u2019s has \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d adds Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan\u2019s has \u201cperformed very well and grown share.\u201d After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan\u2019s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he\u2019s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and \u201cgoing deeper\u201d in the category. As awareness of Bachan\u2019s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. \u201cWe want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,\u201d says Gill. \u201cI want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.\u201d",

        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

        "content": "Rhea Ripley returned to WWE Raw with a fiery promo to open the show. WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley\u2019s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week\u2019s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre\u2019s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

        "content": "Chris Sale, an eight-time All-Star, leads the majors with 13 victories this season. During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard\u2019s chart that focuses specifically on what\u2019s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit\u2013one that\u2019s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week.

The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units\u2013in this country alone, that is.",

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

The fundraising page claims to have been authorized by Trump and will support those wounded or killed in Saturday's \"brutal and horrific assassination attempt.\"Griffin on Sunday called the attempted assassination of Trump a \"tragic and disturbing day in America\" and denounced political violence, calling Americans \"fortunate to have the right to peacefully resolve our political differences by casting our votes.\u201d Griffin, the founder of the Miami-based hedge fund firm Citadel, has donated to conservative causes and candidates in the past, including Trump\u2019s chief 2024 primary rival former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but has so far refrained from donating to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. In May, he said he was waiting to see who Trump chooses to run as his vice presidential running mate before deciding whether to donate (Trump on Monday announced Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate). Representatives for Griffin Catalyst, the philanthropic civic engagement initiative founded by Griffin last year, did not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment Monday.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

        "content": "Neighbors of the man the FBI has said carried out an attempted assassination against Donald Trump said signs in support of the former president have periodically appeared outside the Bethel Park, Pa. home of Thomas Matthew Crooks over the last several years, local news outlets reported. Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

[+] Rasananda resort  June 18, 2012 on the island of Koh Phangan off the coast of Koh Samui . Thailand's official tourism body, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set itself the ambitious target of attracting more than 20 million tourists in 2012. According to TAT, In April, Thailand welcomed 1,659,021 international tourists which is a slight increase of 6.87% over the same in 2011.  (Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.",

        "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer\u2019s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer. Mikel Oyarzabal #11 celebrates with Pedri Gonzalez #16 of Team Spain after scoring a goal during the ... [+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

        "content": "Kim Seon-ho plays the director of a secret agency in 'The Tyrant.' Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.\u201d The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

        "content": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was presented as a new Real Madrid signing. The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club\u2019s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino P\u00e9rez and all 15 of Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League trophies, Mbapp\u00e9 received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club\u2019s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. \u201812 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbapp\u00e9,\u2019 P\u00e9rez said to introduce the player. \u2018Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

        "content": "House of the Dragon vs Game of Thrones If you asked me who my favorite character in Game Of Thrones was, I\u2019d have a really hard time answering simply because there are far too many to choose from. I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO\u2019s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I\u2019d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don\u2019t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She\u2019s noble and kind for the most part. But she\u2019s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard\u2019s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father\u2019s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King\u2019s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark\u2019s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they\u2019re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that\u2019s really missing\u2014the thing that you can\u2019t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you\u2019re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones\u2014is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I\u2019m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he\u2019s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren\u2019t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters\u2014Tyrion perhaps most of all\u2014are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we\u2019ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There\u2019s always a smirk on Aemond\u2019s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon\u2019s eyes, but you\u2019ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what\u2019s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven\u2019t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn\u2019t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are \u201cabout as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.\u201d If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: \u201cA spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.\u201d",

        "content": "TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. #27 of Toronto Blue Jays smiles as he comes off the ... [+] field in a break in play against the Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don\u2019t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball\u2019s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ... [+] after leaving the game in the bottom of the eighth inning against the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on July 09, 2024 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) This season, Kikuchi has made 20 starts, and he\u2019s thrown 117 innings. He has pitched to a 4.42 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - JUNE 24: Chris Bassitt #40 of the Toronto Blue Jays pitches against the ... [+] Boston Red Sox during the first inning at Fenway Park on June 24, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images) Bassitt signed a three-year, $63 million contract in 2023. He will have to be paid the remainder of $22 million this year, and all of $22 million in 2025. Bassitt has a record of 8-7 in 19 starts, covering 107.1 innings. He has struck out an average of 8.4 hitters per nine innings, while walking 3.8. He has yielded eight home runs. Assessment: Inconsistent, but among the better potential starting pitchers on the trade market. TORONTO, ON- JUNE 19  -  Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman (34) as the Toronto Blue Jays fall ... [+] to the Boston Red Sox 7-3 at Rogers Centre in Toronto. June 19, 2024.  Steve Russell/Toronto Star        (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Gausman is working on a five-year, $110 million contract he signed in 2022. He has the remainder of $22 million for this year, and two years at $23 million left on his contract. Gausman has a record of 7-8 in 19 starts covering 104 innings. He has a 4.5 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Gausman is striking out an average of 9 hitters per game, walking 2.3. He has yielded 15 home runs. Assessment-Inconsistency risk, but of value to contending teams. TORONTO, ON - JULY 1: Yariel Rodriguez #29 of Toronto Blue Jays salutes the crowd against the ...

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) Rodriguez signed a five-year, $32 million contract in 2024. There are player and team options in his deal, but his contract has an average annual value of $6.4 million. Rodriguez has made just eight starts. He has a record of 1-3 in 33.1 innings. His ERA is 3.78, and his WHIP is 1.38. He has struck out an average of 9.75, while walking 4.9 per nine innings. He has yielded three home runs. Assessment: To this scout, Rodriguez is the least likely to be traded.",

        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

        "author": "Morten Stig Jensen",
        "content": "Frederik Drejer Erichsen driving towards the basket during NBA Academy play. In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "date": "Jun 11, 2024,02:15pm EDT",
        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

[+] photocall at the Rolling Stones \"Hackney Diamonds\" Launch Event at Hackney Empire on September 06, 2023 in London, England. The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks is the band's first project to spend two full years on the U.K. albums chart, as of this week. (Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they\u2019ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band\u2019s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That\u2019s exactly two years on the tally\u2013and it\u2019s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won\u2019t be able to catch up. The band\u2019s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.\u2014just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn\u2019t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it\u2019s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.",

        "content": "From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan\u2019s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan\u2019s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that\u2019s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. \u201cI wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,\u201d says Gill, \u201cOne that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.\u201d The mass appeal of Bachan\u2019s is one of many reasons why Gill\u2019s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan\u2019s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan\u2019s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan\u2019s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan\u2019s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan\u2019s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce\u2014in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. \u201cI bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,\u201d Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan\u2019s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is \u201ctotally self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,\u201d says Gill. \u201cBut A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.\u201d Gill\u2019s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill\u2019s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill\u2019s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family\u2019s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. \u201cI wanted to do something I love,\u201d Gill recalls, \u201cand really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.\u201d It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. \u201cI really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we\u2019d have something totally different,\u201d says Gill. \u201cAnd if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.\u201d The 10 ingredients Bachan\u2019s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality\u2014certainly more premium than what Gill\u2019s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan\u2019s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan\u2019s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year\u2014from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan\u2019s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d says Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan\u2019s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends\u2014one for $100,000 was tied to his home\u2014but he couldn\u2019t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan\u2019s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan\u2019s\u2014to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the \u201cethnic\u201d aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there\u2019s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan\u2019s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan\u2019s became the top seller in the grocer\u2019s barbecue sauce aisle. \u201cIt can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It\u2019s really regionally driven,\u201d says Whole Foods\u2019 Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. \u201cWhat's exciting about Bachan\u2019s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce\u2014but in a totally different way.\u201d In 2021, Gill raised Bachan\u2019s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon\u2019s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. \u201cIt was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,\u201d says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude\u2019s managing partner and cofounder. \u201cBut it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.\u201d It was Gill\u2019s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan\u2019s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan\u2019s, which Sonoma\u2019s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been \u201cjust mind-blowing to me as an investor.\u201d \u201cIt's a Sriracha 2.0,\u201d Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. \u201cSriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan\u2019s in the same way.\u201d That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America\u2019s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan\u2019s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan\u2019s even got mentioned by Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan\u2019s as an example of how he\u2019s \u201cpersonally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\u201d Bachan\u2019s has \u201cset fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,\u201d adds Damon Keith, Walmart\u2019s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan\u2019s has \u201cperformed very well and grown share.\u201d After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan\u2019s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he\u2019s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and \u201cgoing deeper\u201d in the category. As awareness of Bachan\u2019s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. \u201cWe want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,\u201d says Gill. \u201cI want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.\u201d",

        "content": "The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, \u201cBuy American\u201d rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs\u2014GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada\u2014assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift\u2014two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts\u2014doctors, nurses, police\u2014but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, \u201cEven the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills\u2026arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace\u201d. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They \u201cserve people\u2019s urge to imagine and create the new\u2026to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.\u201d Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.",

        "content": "Rhea Ripley returned to WWE Raw with a fiery promo to open the show. WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley\u2019s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week\u2019s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre\u2019s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week\u2019s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been \u201ca bit of a screamer.\u201d Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan\u2019s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley\u2019s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a \u201cpay your dues\u201d type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega\u2019s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn\u2019t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn\u2019t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE \u201cwas not his dream.\u201d Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest\u2019s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest \u201cstreet trash.\u201d By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest\u2019s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter\u2019s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk \u201cI know where your family lives!\u201d Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn\u2019t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted \u201csay you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can\u2019t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey\u2019s entrance and screaming \u201cdon\u2019t you ever mess with my Mami!\u201d The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to \u201caccidentally\u201d land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik\u2019s rose and said she doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. She\u2019s not Dom\u2019s, he\u2019s hers. Apparently they\u2019re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said \u201cyeah, yeah yeah\u201d in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted \u201cyou F\u2019d up!\u201d Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov\u2019s constant motion as the guy \u201cnever stops.\u201d Fans weren\u2019t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it\u2019s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.",

        "content": "Chris Sale, an eight-time All-Star, leads the majors with 13 victories this season. During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.\u201d Fried agreed. \u201cWhat Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.\u201d Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he\u2019s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. \u201cI want to focus on what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. \u201cI 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We\u2019re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here \u2013 I love it and would love to stay here.\u201d Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don\u2019t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, L\u00f3pez will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball\u2019s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. \u201cPeople talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,\u201d said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. \u201cBut coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.\u201d Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. \u201cWe were all hitters before we were pitchers,\u201d Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. \u201cYou have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.\u201d The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL\u2019s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it\u2019s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next, but there\u2019s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard\u2019s chart that focuses specifically on what\u2019s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit\u2013one that\u2019s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash \u201cThunderstruck\u201d on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That\u2019s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it\u2019s still an important win for the group. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d marks AC/DC\u2019s second hit on the TikTok chart. That\u2019s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune \u201cBack In Black\u201d eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. \u201cThunderstruck\u201d has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units\u2013in this country alone, that is.",

        "content": "Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) is hoping to bounce back after a disappointing ... [+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL\u2019s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers \u2014 who missed the postseason in 2022 \u2014 would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. \u201cI\u2019ve been so close so many years and I\u2019ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,\u201d said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. \u201cBut this group is really coming together, really connecting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of love for each other. It\u2019s built the right way. It\u2019s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we\u2019ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).\u201d Green Bay\u2019s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the \u201830 Most Important Packers\u2019 heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL\u2019s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss \u2014 one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, \u201cTails.\u201d It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to \u201cdefer\u201d the Packers\u2019 choice until the second half. If Alexander said \u201cdefer\u201d like Green Bay\u2019s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. \u201cI said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' \u201c(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.\u201d Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur\u2019s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. \u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, \u2018Hey, we win the toss, we\u2019re going to defer.\u2019 I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.\u201d Alexander was suspended for Green Bay\u2019s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers\u2019 Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. \u201cIt was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,\u201d LaFleur said of Alexander\u2019s suspension. \u201cBut I love how he responded and that\u2019s life. You\u2019ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.\u201d  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst\u2019s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL\u2019s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay\u2019s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay\u2019s 18 games that year \u2014 an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay\u2019s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he\u2019s at a career crossroads and must prove he\u2019s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay\u2019s OTA\u2019s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers\u2019 offseason program this year. \u201cI feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,\u201d Alexander said this offseason. \u201cMan, I'm super motivated \u2026 That's why I'm here.\u201d Green Bay\u2019s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think this is going to work really well.\u201d  \u201cThose things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I\u2019m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.\u201d \u2014 Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but his best. He\u2019s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He\u2019s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He\u2019s been the same guy, so he\u2019s been a joy to work with that way. We\u2019re proud of that. We don\u2019t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he\u2019s got a lot to give.\u201d \u2014 Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander \u201cJa\u2019s been outstanding. Again, he\u2019s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He\u2019s never demeaning. I think he\u2019s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.\u201d \u2014Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander \u201cI mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that\u2019s all behind us know and we\u2019re just going to move forward.\u201d \u2014 Alexander on coming back from his suspension \u2022 No. 30 \u2014 RB AJ Dillon \u2022 No. 29 \u2014 LB Isaiah McDuffie \u2022 No. 28 \u2014 CB Carrington Valentine \u2022 No. 27 \u2014 TE Tucker Kraft \u2022 No. 26 \u2014 LB Edgerrin Cooper \u2022 No. 25 \u2014 DE Lukas Van Ness \u2022 No. 24 \u2014 Keisean Nixon \u2022 No. 23 \u2014 WR Dontayvion Wicks \u2022 No. 22 \u2014 OL Jordan Morgan \u2022 No. 21 \u2014 DL T.J.

Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a campaign event in ... [+] Butler, Pa., July 13, 2024. The fund, created two days ago by Meredith O'Rourke, the finance director of the Trump campaign, has raised $4.7 million\u2014several times its $1 million goal. Major donors to the campaign include Musk ($100,000); Griffin ($100,000); billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn ($50,000); Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his wife, Ann ($50,000); the conservative Heritage Foundation ($50,000); UFC President Dana White ($50,000); Kid Rock ($50,000); former Republican presidential nomination contender Vivek Ramaswamy ($30,000); Ben Shapiro ($15,000) and the conservative news website Shapiro founded, the Daily Wire ($15,000). The fundraising page claims to have been authorized by Trump and will support those wounded or killed in Saturday's \"brutal and horrific assassination attempt.\"Griffin on Sunday called the attempted assassination of Trump a \"tragic and disturbing day in America\" and denounced political violence, calling Americans \"fortunate to have the right to peacefully resolve our political differences by casting our votes.\u201d Griffin, the founder of the Miami-based hedge fund firm Citadel, has donated to conservative causes and candidates in the past, including Trump\u2019s chief 2024 primary rival former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but has so far refrained from donating to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. In May, he said he was waiting to see who Trump chooses to run as his vice presidential running mate before deciding whether to donate (Trump on Monday announced Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate).

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump\u2019s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.",

        "content": "Neighbors of the man the FBI has said carried out an attempted assassination against Donald Trump said signs in support of the former president have periodically appeared outside the Bethel Park, Pa. home of Thomas Matthew Crooks over the last several years, local news outlets reported. Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone\u2019s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks' \"crass jokes that weren\u2019t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, \u201cthe FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\u201d The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found \u201csuspicious devices\u201d both in the suspect\u2019s home and vehicle, which \u201chave been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.\u201d The gunman was not on the FBI\u2019s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters \u201cwe have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.\u201d Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene\u2014which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate\u2019s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks \u201cperformed his job without concern and his background check was clean.\u201d CNN reached Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks\u2019 classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was \u201cbullied almost every day\u201d and was \u201cjust a outcast.\u201d However, another student Mark Sigafoos\u2014who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler\u2014told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was \u201cvery kind\u201d and \u201cnerdy\u201d but wasn\u2019t \u201cas harshly bullied as some people are saying.\u201d Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer \u201che definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u201d Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks\u2019 hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\u201d The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: \u201cWe pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.\u201d \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.",

        "content": "''Faye'' directed by Laurent Bouzereau With one of the most iconic photographs ever taken of a movie star and a simple four- letter name as a poster for his new documentary, director Laurent Bouzereau dives into the life and reputation of one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic and vilified actresses of all time, Faye Dunaway. Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband\u2019s camera, British photographer Terry O'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. \u201cThere are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it\u2019s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?\u201d director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: \u201cSharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it\u2019s something that when we got started, we said \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?\u2019 So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.\u201d It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau\u2019s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, \u201cI am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.\u201d Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway\u2019s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau\u2019s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, \u201cRight off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.\u201d He added: \u201cI said \u2018Let\u2019s just film everything, let\u2019s never cut and see what we come up with.\u2019 At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I\u2019m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that\u2019s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn\u2019t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.\u201d Bouzereau explained that Dunaway\u2019s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, \u201cNot just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it\u2019s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.\u201d Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, \u201cPeople are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.\u201d \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or \u201cRoman the Terror\u201d as she refers to him in the documentary, didn\u2019t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway\u2019s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway\u2019s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, \u201cShe says in the film \u2018I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don\u2019t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWhen she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn\u2019t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.\u201d Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, \u201cFrankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we\u2019ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.\u201d Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? \u201cIt is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there\u2019s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn\u2019t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t like \u2018I got the story, now I can ove on.\u2019 I was literally exhausted from it.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I\u2019m almost a mirror to them. That I\u2019m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.\u201d Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O\u2019Brien praised Trump for having \u201cthe backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention\u201d and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group\u2019s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe are not beholden to anyone or any party.\u201d Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump\u2019s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O\u2019Brien also called out the GOP\u2019s \u201cactive opposition\u201d to labor unions and said, \u201cthis too must change.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he\u2019ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters\u2019 political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year\u2014matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November\u2019s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates\u2014like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union\u2019s membership, according to the group\u2019s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cLabor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.\u201d In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O\u2019Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: \u201cIt is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.\u201d O\u2019Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O\u2019Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O\u2019Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an \u201cin-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.\u201d Since then, O\u2019Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group\u2019s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O\u2019Brien a \u201cscab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.\u201d The Teamster leader\u2019s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: \u201cSome would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.\u201d Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump\u2014With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes\u2014Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)",

(UPDATE: Trump has chosen J.D. Vance\u2014read more here.) Former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the SNHU Arena on January 20, 2024 ... [+] in Manchester, New Hampshire. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump\u2019s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump\u2019s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump\u2019s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he\u2019d be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if he wasn\u2019t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he\u2019s not Trump\u2019s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn\u2019t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum\u2014a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he\u2019s worth about $100 million)\u2014\u201cgreat,\u201d but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is \u201can issue.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, \u201cif you\u2019re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I\u2019ll be talking to you,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d when asked whether he will be on Trump\u2019s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it\u2019s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump\u2019s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton\u2019s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May \u201canyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.\u201d Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump\u2019s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he\u2019ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \u201csolid\u201d potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family\u2019s \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \u201cnasty and mean\u201d goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be \u201con our team in some form\u201d if he\u2019s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis\u2019 donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state\u2019s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida\u2019s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump\u2019s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \u201cchoose between him and the Constitution.\u201d Trump has countered that Pence is \u201cdelusional.\u201d Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties\u2019 nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump\u2019s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \u201canyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Police and Secret Service snipers returned fire and killed the gunman who shot at the former ... [+] President Trump on Saturday. Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman \u201cscoping out\u201d the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter\u201420-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2014was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower\u2014which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters\u2014for their failure to stop Crooks, along with \u201cextremely poor planning.\u201d According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks\u2019 phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was \u201cmotivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.\u201d What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As \u2018Comically Bad Shot\u2019: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)",

        "content": "The stellar success of blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound has companies eager to break into the lucrative weight loss drug market \u2014 here are the hopeful rivals preparing to challenge Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for dominance in the obesity drug gold rush. Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide\u2014an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease\u2014and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become \u201cthe backbone of therapy for weight management\u201d after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled\u2014and outperformed\u2014Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290\u2014the drug surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year\u2014that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become \u201ca best-in-class\u201d and makes an \u201can ideal backbone\u201d for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide\u2014which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro\u2014that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year\u2014a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects\u2014but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to \u201cplay and win\u201d in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following \u201cencouraging\u201d data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2014respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound\u2014dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune\u2019s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That\u2019s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more\u2014some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s\u2014and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies\u2019 position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

[+] Rasananda resort  June 18, 2012 on the island of Koh Phangan off the coast of Koh Samui . Thailand's official tourism body, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set itself the ambitious target of attracting more than 20 million tourists in 2012. According to TAT, In April, Thailand welcomed 1,659,021 international tourists which is a slight increase of 6.87% over the same in 2011.  (Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.",

However, the tourism industry can be volatile and is often affected by factors beyond TAT's control, such as global economic conditions and political stability. Therefore, while TAT appears to be performing well, there is a moderate level of credit risk due to the inherent uncertainties in the tourism industry."

        "content": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer\u2019s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be\u2014an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today\u2019s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. \u201cWhat I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that's who you are\u2014for 50 years you've done nothing but cheat the talent,\u201d says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. \u201cThe studio side narrative is, I can't believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They're just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.\u201d With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series\u2019 profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear\u2014which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing\u2014Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it\u2019s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that\u2019s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW\u2019s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey\u2019s Anatomy) make in a given year\u2014with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: 'The Bear' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors\u2014first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services\u2014an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show\u2019s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show\u2019s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren\u2019t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. \u201cThe world is so much more fragmented now,\u201d says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe definition of a hit is clearly different in today\u2019s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that\u2019s the reality of how the business operates today.\u201d Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called \u201cSeries Bonus Exhibit,\u201d or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a \u201cLongevity Bonus\u201d for season renewals\u2014roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4\u2014a \u201cCurrent Series Ranking Bonus\u201d for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer\u2019s most-watched rankings, and a \u201cCritical Acclaim Bonus\u201d for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show\u2019s financial breakeven point, which often didn\u2019t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called \u201chome runs\u201d that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table\u2014even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. \u201cEverybody in the room laughed,\u201d says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. \u201cBecause that's the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there\u2019ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year\u2019s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it\u2019s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show\u2019s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That\u2019s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won\u2019t suddenly increase the value of a single show. \u201cAdvertising on streaming isn\u2019t intended to make money,\u201d says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cAdvertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You\u2019re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you\u2019re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.\u201d For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry\u2019s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show\u2019s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, \u201cif this was 2021, I would\u2019ve expected it to be $1.2 million.\u201d At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear\u2014which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience\u2014is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. \u201cUnfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,\u201d says the same dealmaker. \u201cAs compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn't really work for that.\"",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. \u201cThe national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,\u201d the account Awful Announcing penned on X. \u201cIt is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,\u201d added another X user. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I\u2019ve ever heard in my whole life,\u201d wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie\u2019s infamous live version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. \u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 was not good. I\u2019m sorry, but it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re all thinking it and it has to be said,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

She was nominated for four Grammys, including Best New Artist, Best Country Song, and Best Country Album in 2021. In 2023, her track with Sam Hunt titled \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d was a contender for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.

        "content": "Mikel Oyarzabal of Spain scores his team's second goal in the UEFA EURO 2024 final against England ... [+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn\u2019t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England\u2019s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain\u2019s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England\u2019s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer. Mikel Oyarzabal #11 celebrates with Pedri Gonzalez #16 of Team Spain after scoring a goal during the ... [+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren\u2019t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d\u2019Or candidate, has said this Spanish group \u201chad done good things together at youth level\u201d and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain\u2019s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can\u2019t replicate. Spain\u2019s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates\u2019 play that could help build the spine Spain\u2019s senior side in the future.",

The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. \u201cIt was my very first time to work on a series,\u201d said Park. \u201cAnd it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time.

The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' \u201cI'm a big fan of his,\u201d said Cha. \u201cThis is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.\u201d Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director\u2018s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. \u201cI worked on The Childe with Director Park,\u201d said Kim Seon-ho. \u201cI love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.\u201d \u201cSeon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.\u201d Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. \u201cWhen I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,\u201d said Park. \u201cHe was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.\u201d The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he\u2019s complicated. \u201cBecause this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,\u201d said Kim Kang-woo. \u201cSo that was quite a challenge.\u201d Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. \u201cWhen you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,\u201d said Park. \u201cBut she\u2019s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.\u201d Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo\u2019s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he\u2019s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. \u201cI would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,\u201d said Jo. \u201cAt first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.\u201d \u201cShe didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,\u201d said Park. \u201cShe is just amazing with her punches.\u201d When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, \u201cThis is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.\u201d The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.",

        "title": "For Boeing, Buying Spirit Is Only The Start Of Solving Its Problems",
        "date": "Jul 1, 2024,06:00pm EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Boeing 737 Max fuselages manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, are transported on a BSNF train heading west over the Bozeman Pass in Montana en route to the Boeing assembly plant in Renton, Washington. Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. \u201cThis is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,\u201d said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. \u201cAnd then one of them says, \u2018I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.\u2019 This is not going to solve either company's problems.\u201d Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing\u2019s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It\u2019s unclear that Boeing\u2019s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. \u201cIt's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit\u2019s does,\u201d said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as \u201cone of the most significant\u201d the company has taken to strengthen quality. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories \u2013 where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.\u201d In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn\u2019t a possibility with fuselages because they\u2019re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit\u2019s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit\u2019s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. \u201cTo some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,\u201d said Collier. \u201cBut then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?\u201d Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren\u2019t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. \u201cIt still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],\u201d Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It\u2019s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. \u201cThat is the fundamental solution to zero defects,\u201d he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a multi-year thing\u201d to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit\u2019s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. \u201cYou're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you\u2019ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.\u201d Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit\u2019s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing\u2019s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. \u201cIf they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt's just a giant self-inflicted wound.\u201d Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing\u2019s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors \u2013 most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing \u201cparadoxically fills me with hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Gradiant cofounders Prakash Govindan (left) and Anurag Bajpayee  Lithium is hugely important to electrifying the world\u2019s vehicles, with just one car\u2019s battery requiring more than 17 pounds of it. But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment \u2013 and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. \u201cThe demand side of lithium is crazy,\u201d said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.\u201d To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine \u2013 naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions \u2013 and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. \u201cWe believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.\u201d The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant\u2019s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold\u2019s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant\u2019s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it\u2019s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents \u201cless than 10%\u201d of Gradiant\u2019s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company\u2019s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they\u2019d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.\u201d The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. \u201cMining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,\u201d Govindan said. \u201cWe are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.\u201d One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. \u201cIn my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,\u201d said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB\u2019s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB\u2019s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is doable, then the world doesn\u2019t have a lithium problem.\u201d Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. \u201cThere are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it\u2019s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.\u201d",

We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.\u2019 Mbapp\u00e9 emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, \u2018hello everyone, I\u2019m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it\u2019s incredible to be here. I\u2019ve dreamt about this for many years, I\u2019m a very happy boy today.\u2019 The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbapp\u00e9 will wear. Set at a price tag of \u20ac170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club\u2019s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbapp\u00e9 wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbapp\u00e9 could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbapp\u00e9 is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.",

        "content": "TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. #27 of Toronto Blue Jays smiles as he comes off the ... [+] field in a break in play against the Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don\u2019t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball\u2019s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer\u2019s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team\u2019s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team\u2019s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette\u2019s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn\u2019t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ... [+] after leaving the game in the bottom of the eighth inning against the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on July 09, 2024 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) This season, Kikuchi has made 20 starts, and he\u2019s thrown 117 innings. He has pitched to a 4.42 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - JUNE 24: Chris Bassitt #40 of the Toronto Blue Jays pitches against the ... [+] Boston Red Sox during the first inning at Fenway Park on June 24, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Brian Fluharty/Getty Images) Bassitt signed a three-year, $63 million contract in 2023. He will have to be paid the remainder of $22 million this year, and all of $22 million in 2025. Bassitt has a record of 8-7 in 19 starts, covering 107.1 innings. He has struck out an average of 8.4 hitters per nine innings, while walking 3.8. He has yielded eight home runs. Assessment: Inconsistent, but among the better potential starting pitchers on the trade market. TORONTO, ON- JUNE 19  -  Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Kevin Gausman (34) as the Toronto Blue Jays fall ...

Steve Russell/Toronto Star        (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Gausman is working on a five-year, $110 million contract he signed in 2022. He has the remainder of $22 million for this year, and two years at $23 million left on his contract. Gausman has a record of 7-8 in 19 starts covering 104 innings. He has a 4.5 ERA, and 1.30 WHIP. Gausman is striking out an average of 9 hitters per game, walking 2.3. He has yielded 15 home runs. Assessment-Inconsistency risk, but of value to contending teams.

There are player and team options in his deal, but his contract has an average annual value of $6.4 million. Rodriguez has made just eight starts. He has a record of 1-3 in 33.1 innings. His ERA is 3.78, and his WHIP is 1.38. He has struck out an average of 9.75, while walking 4.9 per nine innings. He has yielded three home runs. Assessment: To this scout, Rodriguez is the least likely to be traded.",

        "date": "Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT",
        "author": "Jeremy Bogaisky",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there\u2019s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines \u201cflat-footed,\u201d said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. \u201cThey don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.\u201d Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, \u201cthey're essentially like bank accounts,\u201d said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs \u201caren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.\u201d Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They\u2019re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company\u2019s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can\u2019t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There\u2019s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they\u2019re offering tech support for buyers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a developer anymore,\u201d said Gosschalk. \u201cThe accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.\u201d Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they\u2019ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they\u2019ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn\u2019t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines\u2019 success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn\u2019t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines\u2019 security measures haven\u2019t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don\u2019t require multi-factor authentication because they\u2019re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there\u2019s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it\u2019s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. \u201cIt's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,\u201d said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication \u2013 for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines\u2019 online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. \u201cYou can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials \u2026 then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.\u201d",

        "date": "Jul 16, 2024,05:31am EDT",
        "author": "Morten Stig Jensen",
        "content": "Frederik Drejer Erichsen driving towards the basket during NBA Academy play. In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year's draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It's 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He's already been in the game, so he knows what's going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he's got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn't hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg's two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he's allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.",

May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported\u201410 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school\u2019s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University\u2019s encampment, the college\u2019s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane\u2019s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an \u201cunlawful occupation.\u201d May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona\u2019s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with \u201caggravated assault against a peace officer,\u201d the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University\u2019s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated \u201c40 to 50\u201d who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York\u2019s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University\u2019s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment\u2014although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would \u201cnot bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\u201d April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University\u2019s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members\u2014leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university\u2019s direct investments and reestablish an \u201cAdvisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,\u201d which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment\u2014but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University\u2019s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on \u201cdivestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.\u201d The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA\u2019s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting \u201cthought we fucking shot someone.\u201d 2,200. That\u2019s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college\u2019s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their \u201clegislative jurisdiction\u201d over the nation\u2019s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen\u2019s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their \u201chumanitarian\u201d stance and even offered them admission. \u201cWe are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,\u201d a university official told Reuters.",

        "author": "David Blackmon",
        "content": "A man looks at a Tesla Cybertruck parked near the SpaceX Starship as it stands on the launch pad ... [+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled \u201c9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.\u201d It\u2019s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let\u2019s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we\u2019re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a \u201cpeak\u201d in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such \u201cpeak\u201d will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January\u2019s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January\u2019s piece, I wrote that the \u201cfactors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.\u201d Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to \u2018so far, so good.\u2019 But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It\u2019s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.",

Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump appears during the Republican ... [+] National Convention Monday, July 15, 2024, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday\u2019s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said \u201cbiological males\u201d should not be competing in women\u2019s sports and denounced the \u201csexualization and indoctrination of our children,\u201d and Greene said \u201clet me state this clearly, there are only two genders.\u201d Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday\u2019s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday\u2019s is \u201cMake America Wealthy Once Again.\u201d Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. \u201cI cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,\u201d he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump\u2019s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

        "title": "How November Election Results Could Slow Down The US Energy Transition",
        "date": "Jun 11, 2024,02:15pm EDT",
        "author": "Wood Mackenzie",
        "content": "With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion\u2013materially higher than the annual average of US$80\u202fbillion over the last decade\u2013according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it\u2019s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US\u2019 reliance on China.",

Some of that is ending\n  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and\n  reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\n  economist Brian Hamley said.\n      \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\n  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\n  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\n  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\n  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n      \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\n  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the\n  U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\n  said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\n  and the currency looks stable?\"\n      But turning that capital into more permanent productive\n  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n      \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\n  direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\n  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\n  economic statement on May 14.\n      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\n  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\n  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\n  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\n  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n      \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\n  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\n  might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\n  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\n  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n      \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\n  they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\n  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\n  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\n  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\n  policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\n  the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\n  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\n  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\n  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\n  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\n  Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\n  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\n  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\n  equities, particularly in the gold sector.\n      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\n  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\n  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\n  same period.\n      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\n  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in\n  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real\n  estate, particularly in the tourism field.\n      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star\n  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\n  as indicative of the type of property being sought.\n      \"They think they find good value real estate here which,\n  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\n  investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.",

        "title": "BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION",
        "content": "Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\n  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to\n  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\n      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\n  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\n  protectionism and control on capital movements.\n      \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\n  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\n  them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\n  determined market trends.\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\n  rise faster than GNP.\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\n  investment in the U.S.\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.",

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\n  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\n  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\n  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\n  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\n  possibly to 140 yen.\n      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\n  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\n  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\n  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\n  operators to test the downside.\n      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\n  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\n  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\n  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\n  near term, the traders said.\n      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\n  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\n  downward trend.\n      Traders in several centres said the market would look for\n  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\n  defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\n  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\n  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n  \"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The\n  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\n  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\n  Easter weekend.

        "content": "Economists said that they doubt the\n  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite\n  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week\n  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.\n      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged\n  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln\n  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were\n  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\n      \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\n  probably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\n      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\n  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\n  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\n  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\n      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\n  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\n  often pushes up borrrowings.\n      \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\n  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\n  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said\n  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\n  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\n  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\n      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\n  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\n  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\n      The Fed took no market reserve management action last\n  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\n  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\n      \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\n  this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\n      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\n  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\n  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\n  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the\n  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\n      \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\n  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\n  tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\n      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\n  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\n  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed\n  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\n      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\n  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\n  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\n  imbalance between the United States and Japan.\n      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\n  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\n  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\n  the rate has been since early November.\n      \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\n  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\n  Dean Witter.\n      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\n  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\n  six to 6.10 pct previously.",

        "content": "Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial\n  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's\n  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that\n  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.\n      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline\n  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n      \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\n  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\n  by 33 points to 2339.\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\n  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\n  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n      \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n      \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\n  massive budget deficit.\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\n  weakness,\" he said.\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n      \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\n  will have been greater.\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.",

        "content": "Major U.S. banks may lift prime\n  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in\n  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is\n  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.\n      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most\n  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to\n  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own\n  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\n  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\n  percentage point.\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\n      \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\n  market than most economists had expected.\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\n      \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\n  said Jones of Lanston.\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\n  overtly at some point.\"\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\n  further aid the dollar.\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.",

        "content": "A cut of about half a percentage point\n  in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although\n  economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.\n      Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,\n  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide\n  premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,\n  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.\n      Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances\n  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its\n  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.\n      That rate has remained in force, just holding above the\n  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial\n  bank borrowings.\n      Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German\n  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,\n  forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.\n      In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to\n  three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money\n  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans\n  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.\n      Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance\n  Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.\n      In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he\n  would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance\n  Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion\n  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct\n  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.\n      Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference\n  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under\n  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add\n  extra liquidity to the money market.\n      Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to\n  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would\n  result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,\n  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.\n      The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its\n  parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673\n  guilders per 100 marks.\n      Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10\n  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level\n  that would not permit a change in the interest rate\n  differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers\n  said.\n      An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and\n  Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he\n  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\n  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\n  in the longer term.\n      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\n  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\n  point to a falling rate of economic growth.\n      \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\n  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\n  the ABN economist said.\n      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\n  January, could also contribute to some inflation.\n      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\n  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\n  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\n  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\n  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\n  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\n  five pct.\n      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\n  the money market.",

        "content": "The dollar's recent signs of stability\n  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,\n  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until\n  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.\n      \"The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the\n  dollar has bottomed out,\" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.\n      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value\n  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially\n  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on\n  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.\n      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen\n  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,\n  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.\n      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far\n  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.\n      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March\n  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued\n  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.\n      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if\n  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up\n  towards 150 yen.\n      \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed\n  out for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First National\n  Bank of Chicago.\n      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing\n  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would\n  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's\n  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and \n  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.\n      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen\n  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central\n  bank intervention to support the dollar.\n      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that\n  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion\n  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount\n  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.\n      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention\n  volume as \"impressive\".\n      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,\n  however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade\n  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and\n  140 yen.\"\n      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York\n  warned, \"I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.\"\n      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada\n  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of\n  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.\n      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction\n  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,\n  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous\n  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.\n      President Reagan said today, \"economic policy decisions\n  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of\n  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be\n  ignored or forgotten.\"\n      \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be\n  translated into action,\" he added in a speech, celebrating the\n  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.\n      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,\n  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the\n  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.\n      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, \"pressure will build up on\n  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.\"\n      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar\n  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come\n  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is\n  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade\n  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust\n  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar\n  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign\n  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short\n  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.",

        "title": "POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK",
        "content": "For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is\n  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has\n  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for\n  the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the\n  mark.\n      President of the powerful and independent West German\n  central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his\n  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the\n  end of this year, government officials say.\n      (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)\n      But no official announcement has yet been made, raising\n  eyebrows in West Germany's business community.\n      The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top\n  ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in\n  opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.\n      There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl\n  would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own\n  Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked\n  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\n  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\n  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\n  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\n  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\n  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\n  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\n  of galloping inflation this century.\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\n  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n      \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\n  economy,\" she said.\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\n  currencies.\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\n  don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\n  round, making a speculator's position worthless.\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\n  play golf.\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\n  are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\n  many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\n  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.",

They\n  added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge\n  of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend\n  foreign exchange to importers and exporters.\n      Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks\n  reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,\n  according to official statistics.\n      Last week the central bank said that from today it would\n  reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40\n  pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move\n  was needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange\n  market.\n      Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,\n  have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank\n  market to avoid exchange rate losses.\n      Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May\n  reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9\n  billion in April.\n      All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted\n  into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming\n  exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in\n  the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.\n      In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on\n  remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to\n  Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.\n      Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of\n  the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of\n  speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has\n  flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..\n      Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about\n  22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.\n      Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the\n  foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on\n  capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will\n  be dropped by the end of July or early August.\n      Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused\n  jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy\n  purchases of U.S. Dollars.

He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\n      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction\n  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"\n      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\n  \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy\n  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\n  he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate.\n      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\n  currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing\n  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\n  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"\n      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\n  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\n  commitments underlying the accord.\n      \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\n  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\n  commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.\n  Budget deficit was \"very important.\"\n      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\n  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\n  said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\n  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"\n      \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\n  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\n  wholly unjustified,\" he said.\n      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan\n  bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\n  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\n  Japanese development aid over the next three years.\n      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\n  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\n      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\n  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\n  jack up faltering economic growth.\n      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\n  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\n  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with\n  the privatisation of German national industries.\n      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan\n  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to\n  make progress in Venice.\n      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign\n  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World\n  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.\n      Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing\n  for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would\n  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\n      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase\n  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt\n  provisions.\n      \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market\n  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this\n  sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.\n      U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,\n  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.\n  \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\"\n  Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to\n  determine the appropriate size of provisions.\n      He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be\n  discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to\n  push further.\"",

That would not\n  represent a tightening of policy, however.\n      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\n  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\n  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\n  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\n  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\n  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\n  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French\n  occupation this century.\n      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\n  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\n  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\n  treated for minimum reserve purposes.",

Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\n  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\n  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\n  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\n  economists said.\n      \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan\n  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\n  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\n  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\n  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\n  as better gauges of economic growth.\n      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\n  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\n  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\n      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\n  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\n  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\n      \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\n  market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end\n  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"\n      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings\n  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period\n  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had\n  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.\n      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day\n  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher\n  borrowings target would probably have been reached.\n      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in\n  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,\n  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has\n  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.\n      \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed\n  easing at some point,\" he said.\n      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little\n  attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of\n  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the\n  economy,\" one said. \"I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is\n  falling apart and the Fed should ease.\"\n      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a\n  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary\n  policy.\n      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates\n  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and\n  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke\n  off econmomic growth.\n      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late\n  April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a\n  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives\n  them more room to ease,\" he said.",

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the\n  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\"\n      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which\n  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the\n  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation\n  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.\n      \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street\n  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said\n  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from\n  other London and Tokyo analysts.\n      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of\n  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary\n  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.\n      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the\n  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.\n      \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of\n  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their\n  interest rates,\" he added.\n      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime\n  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed\n  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial\n  system.\n      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock\n  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking\n  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.\n      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of\n  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880.

        "content": "The United States appears to have won a\n  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest\n  rates, European economists said.\n      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing\n  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were\n  plunging.\n      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.\n  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to\n  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,\n  according to official statements released late Monday.\n      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the\n  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks\n  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct\n  facility rate offered last week.\n      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank\n  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added\n  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a\n  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.\n       \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid,\n  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in\n  London.\n      But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one\n  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West\n  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05\n  percentage point.\"\n      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening\n  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and\n  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.\n      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's\n  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary\n  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\n  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\n  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\n  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\n  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\n      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\n  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\n  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\n  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\n      \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\n  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\n  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.\n      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\n  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\n  in the U.S., Aschoff said.\n      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\n  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\n  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\n      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\n  Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\n  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\n  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\n  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"\n      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\n  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\n  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\n      Economists said the United States now appeared to have\n  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\n  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\n      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\n  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\n  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\n  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\n  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\n      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\n  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\n  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central\n  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them\n  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.",

        "title": "TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP",
        "content": "As official Washington sought to\n  restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street\n  collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from\n  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.\n      Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for\n  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an\n  international accord to stabilize currency values.\n      Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was\n  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped\n  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors\n  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would\n  damage the world economy.\n      Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"I\n  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I\n  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by\n  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a\n  dispute that should never have happened, he added.\n      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a\n  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  \n  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United\n  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to\n  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.\n      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His\n  timing could not have been worse.\"\n      One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually\n  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack\n  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much\n  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"\n      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\n  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\n      \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\n  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\n  markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of\n  Nikko Securities International in New York.\n      \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\n  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the\n  messenger,\" he said.\n      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\n  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\n  in Paris in February, was still in effect.\n      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\n  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\n  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\n  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\n     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\n  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\n  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\n  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\n      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\n  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\n  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\n  market for debtor country exports.\n      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\n  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential\n  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\n  tarnished.\n      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\n  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\n  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\n      \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\n  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\n  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\n  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"\n  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\n  television interview.\n      In many ways, the official response was mild.\n      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\n  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\n  that he was \"puzzled.\"\n      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\n  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\n  and, presumably, their political impact.\n      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\n  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.\n      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\n  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\n  Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to\n  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\n  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\n  retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do\n  that.\"",

        "content": "News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury\n  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the\n  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.\n      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great\n  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by\n  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears\n  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.\n      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two\n  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.\n      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by\n  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously\n  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York\n  markets.\n      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies\n  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry\n  spokesman in Bonn said.\n      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of\n  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\n  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\n  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\n  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\n  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\n  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\n  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\n  deficit.\n      West German government sources said rising West German\n  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\n  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\n  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\n  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\n  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n      German yields have also risen over this period, but less\n  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\n  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security\n  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\n  money market.\n      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\n  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\n  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\n  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\n  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\n  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\n  bank economists said.\n      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\n  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\n  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\n  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\n  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\n  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\n  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n      \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\n  under American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\n  Swiss Bank Corp here.\n      \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\n  significant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\n  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\n  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\n  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\n  economists said.\n      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\n  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\n  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\n  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\n  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance\n  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\n  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\n  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\n  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\n  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit\n  Denmark and Belgium.",

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\n  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\n  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\n  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\n  views, bankers said.\n      \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\n  Pfister.\n      \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\n  entirely his own,\" said another economist.\n      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\n  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\n  and hurting West German exporters.\n      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\n  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\n  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\n  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\n  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\n  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\n  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\n  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\n  most popular government politician last year, had to face\n  resistance from local barons in the government coalition\n  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n  4.3 billion marks.\n      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\n  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\n  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\n  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\n  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of\n  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\n  allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\n  losses for the CDU in state elections.\n      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\n  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\n  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\n  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\n  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\n  gave Poehl another eight-year term.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\n  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\n  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\n  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.",

        "content": "Recent slackness on Dutch capital\n  markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's\n  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark\n  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.\n      While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the\n  guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use\n  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can\n  fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System\n  (EMS).\n      Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV\n  (Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.\n      \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the\n  range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the\n  presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.\n      Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against\n  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.\n      The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to\n  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a\n  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\n  policies to influence the exchange rate.\n      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\n  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\n      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\n      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\n  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\n  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\n  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\n  obtain.\"\n      Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\n  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\n  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\n  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\n  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\n  added.\n      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\n  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\n  Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\n  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\n  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\n      \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\n  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\n      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\n  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\n  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the\n  two does not differ much, economists said.\n      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\n  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\n  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\n  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\n  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\n      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\n  and exchange rates.\n      West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading\n  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\n  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\n  Statistics figures show.\n      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\n  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\n  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.\n      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\n  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\n  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\n      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\n  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\n  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\n  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\n  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\n      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\n  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\n  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\n      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\n  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\n  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\n  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\n  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\n      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\n  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\n      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\n  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\n  narrow.\n      \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\n  between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the\n  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell\n  large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director\n  Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.\n      \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the\n  markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.\n  We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the\n  mark,\" he said.",

It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n      Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\n  rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\n  uncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n      But at the same time, worries about the international debt\n  crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\n  pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n      The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\n  more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\n  world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n      Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\n  the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\n  urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\n  securitisation of  business.\n      Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\n  Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\n  mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\n  investment banking.",

It recommended that to stop friction\n  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\n  transformation in its traditional policies on economic\n  management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\n  development for Japan without this transformation.\"\n      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\n  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\n  Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\n  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\n  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\n  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\n  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\n  semiconductor pact.\n      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\n  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\n  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\n  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\n  telecommunications joint venture.\n      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\n  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\n  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\n      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\n  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\n  views last November when he visited the European Community.\n  \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\n  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\n  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\n  results of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n      \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\n  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\n  domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\n      Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\n  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\n  only know that your government, under the leadership of\n  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\n  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\n  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\n  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the\n  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\n  we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\n  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\n  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\n  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\n  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\n  problem.\n      \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\n  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\n  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n      \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\n  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\n  labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\n  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\n  the country asking about this issue.\n      He said People mentioned many things in line with the\n  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\n  steel industries.\n      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\n  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,\n  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the \"leadership\" of the\n  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\n  September's government programme of new economic measures.\n  \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\n  that the government has put its signature to a programme\n  designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.",
