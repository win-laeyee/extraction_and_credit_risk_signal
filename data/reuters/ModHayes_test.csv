"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he would not agree to an extension of the 18-month
whole dairy herd buyout program set to expire later this year.
    Speaking at the Agriculture Department to representatives
of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, Lyng said some
dairymen asked the program be extended.
    But he said the Reagan administration, which opposed the
whole herd buyout program in the 1985 farm bill, would not
agree to an extension.
    The program begun in early 1986, is to be completed this
summer. U.S. cattlemen bitterly opposed the scheme, complaining
that increased dairy cow slaughter drove cattle prices down
last year.

"The World Bank will prepay on July 9,
1987 and July 17, 1987 the total amount outstanding of two
Swiss franc public issues, in the first of what could be a
series of similar moves in other capital markets, a spokesman
for the Bank said in a telephone call from Washington.
    The prepayments cover 96 mln Swiss francs of 6-1/2 pct
Swiss franc bonds of 1976 and due 1991, lead managed by Swiss
Bank Corporation and 100 mln Swiss francs of 7-3/8 pct bonds of
1981 and due 1991, lead managed by Credit Suisse.
    Eugene Rotberg, World Bank vice president-treasurer, said
in a prepared statement that the prepayments are being made
because of the substantial decline in interest rates over the
past two years, the spokesman said.
    The World Bank intends to exercise early redemption on
selected public issues of its securities in Switzerland and
other capital markets if the exercise is financially beneficial
and consistent with the Bank's overall funding strategy.
    Last month, Rotberg said that the World Bank planned to
bring forward to the first half of 1987 its borrowing plans for
the year because of its expectations that world interest rates
will rise by the year end.

"Several industrial nations are
pressing the United States to consider whether its debt
strategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needs
to be strengthened, monetary sources say.
    While few nations are ready to pour vast sums of money into
radical ""debt relief"" style solutions to the debt crisis,
pressure is building for a greater International Monetary Fund
role in the plan.
    But U.S. officials, who are fighting off demands for change
by Congress, are confident they will retain support for their
strategy which will probably be endorsed in a communique
issued by the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee.
    One Reagan administration official said a recent discussion
among leading industrial countries showed there was ""very broad
and strong support for continuing the strategy"".
    The official said in an interview, ""I don't sense that
there's a strong desire to revise the debt strategy, except of
course here on (Capitol) Hill.""
    But monetary sources said some industrial nations, like
France and Italy, are troubled by signs the strategy is
increasingly strained. Britain too is said to be concerned.
    In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral development
banks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increase
loans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over three
years.
    In return, the major debtors were expected to undertake
reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more open
markets and a reduced government role in the economy.
    The IMF was to retain a ""central role"" in the strategy,
shifting its economic reform programs from emphasizing
austerity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreign
investment in debtor nations.
    But monetary sources said some nations want even more
flexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to
loans for debtor nations.
    Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets
-- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met
-- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitor
economic performance.
    There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too
low and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for
tawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased.
    The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with the
World Bank next week, will only be a small net lender this
year. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments.
    Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States,
acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments.
    Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is 
particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks
to lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say.
    New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood to
be worried about the Fund's image in the developing world,
where it is often depicted as the source of economic ills.
    Camdessus' experience as former chairman of the so-called
""Paris Club"" of western creditor governments, has given him
extensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis.
    Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymernts
moratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, has
flatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economic
reforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debt
repayments to 10 pct of exports.
    But the administration official said Brazil's strategy of
using a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. ""It's
probably turning out to be more complicated than they thought.
It underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes on
itself when it begins down that road,"" the official said.
    Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writing
down their Brazilian loans.
    U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors for
adopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral
institutions for stepping up their lending.
    And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the
Philippines have struck agreement with commercial banks
stretching out debt repayments.
    But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bank
loan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be the
last major cash loan for a debtor country.
    Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novel
ways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations.
    The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt
strategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to
come up with more finance.
    While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms of
debt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF are
a virtual impossibility in today's era of budget restraint.
    That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West
Germany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief.
    And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow to
Congressional pressure for changes in regulations governing
foreign loans, to make it easier for banks to account for
delays in interest and principal repayments.

"The European Community responded to
widespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishing
an extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to EC
exports.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed
25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a
similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in
November, and updated a previous EC list.
    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq
said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken
by trading partners of the U.S. And that ""the U.S. Were not
innocents in the matter.""
    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial
relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff
measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping
procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.
    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were
necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,
and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming
international trade talks. ""The purpose of the report is to make
clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a
unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face
similar problems in the U.S.,"" it said.
    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import
restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,
certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and
machine tools.
    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.
The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement
program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of
9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8
mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies
granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.
    ""The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.
EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will
continue to do so,"" it said, adding the current GATT round would
also provide an opportunity to address the subject.
    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.
On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and
certain cottons, restrict EC exports.
    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord
on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,
standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.
Administration's ""buy American"" public procurement policy.

"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding 
import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist
response in the United States.
    ""Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the
country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very
concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might
be very serious,"" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.
    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand ""total
elimination"" of the beef import quota by April 1988.
    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may
strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng
said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.
    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might
retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the
semiconductor dispute.
    ""They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,"" Lyng
said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan
has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.
    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese
beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice
in food purchases.
    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for
eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as
well.
    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm
products, principally grains and soybeans.

"Japanese press reports said Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his
controversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread opposition
even within his own party.
    The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his
ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax
should be amended if there was anything wrong with it.
    Officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as
part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system.
    But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him
as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese
people if they hated it.
    Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax
breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July
and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet
government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth.
    Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to

opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP.

"In a fresh sign of the strains caused

    Brazil was previously ranked as an ""other transfer risk
problem."" Reserves would have to be set aside for loans to
Brazil only if its credit rating were lowered by another notch

deterioration in Brazil's finances.
    The downgrading was decided by the Interagency Country
Valuation Review Committee, which groups regulators from
the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
and the Comptroller of the Currency.
    The downgrading coincides with the move by several major
U.S. banks to place their loans to Brazil on non-accrual status
because of the February 20 suspension of interest on 68 billion
dlrs of term debt.
    By declaring the loans non-performing, the banks wipe out

criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.

"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said a possible recession in western Europe or Japan
was possible as a result of the U.S. dollar's decline and the
resulting drop in the U.S. trade deficit.
    Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, ""They certainly
have the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust"" to the U.S.
reduction in imports.
    Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them from
going into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was
""certainly possible"" and was the reason why they should adjust
their monetary, fiscal and tax policies.
    Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) whether the U.S. trade
deficit would improve more if the value of the dollar dropped
further, Yeutter replied, ""That should be a mathematical truism.""
But he added that markets are more complicated than that.
    He said he expected the current decline in the dollar to
show up soon in the decline in the value of imports.
    He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less from
Japan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe where
there's less rigidity on imports.

"The World Bank over the last month repaid
and refinanced 500 billion yen in loans at more favourable
interest rates in what was the first step in a plan to
refinance its existing debt, Eugene Rotberg, World Bank
vice-president/treasurer said.
    He told Reuters in a telephone interview from Washington
that the moves are consistent with, but not driven by, the
Bank's view that interest rates have essentially bottomed out
and will move higher by year-end.
    Rotberg was responding to a question following news the
Bank would exercise its option to prepay early some 196 mln
Swiss francs of existing bonds in the Swiss franc market.
    The bond redemptions are the first in the public market and
may be followed by similar moves in other capital markets if
the Bank considers the exercise financially beneficial and
consistent with its overall funding strategy.
    Rotberg noted that the World Bank is very liquid right now,
with some 18 billion dlrs in cash available. The Bank will be
looking at various instruments and the levels they are trading
at in determining what issues will be repaid, he said.
    However, Rotberg said that unlike the yen loans, there was
no immediate plan to refinance the Swiss franc bonds, although
the Bank could possibly issue new debt in that market over the
next few months.
    He said that the yen loans, which were the equivalent of
some three billion dlrs principal amount, had been from the
Japanese long-term credit banks, trust banks and insurance
companies and had interest rates of between seven and nine pct.
    All the borrowings were refinanced as traditional
syndicated loans with the same parities at the Japanese
long-term prime rate, currently 5.8 pct.
    The World Bank borrows in excess of 10 billion dlrs a year,
with almost all its borrowings in medium and long-term fixed
rate markets.
    Rotberg declined to say whether the 1/4 point rise in U.S.
Prime rates yesterday to 7-3/4 pct signalled a reversal in the
trend in interest rates. ""Over the short term, rates could go up
or they could go down,"" he said, adding that the bank takes a
longer view on interest rates when deciding its financing
strategy. However, given the current level of interest rates,
it would not be wise to take short-term money on to the
liability side of the Bank's balance sheet, he said.

"Heightened concern over renewed
inflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward move
could drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as
9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of Sunshine
Mining Co told Reuters in an interview.
    ""The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested in
silver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice of
inflation hedgers,"" said Boswell.
    The strength could put silver in a range of ""8.00 to 9.00
dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,""
Boswell said.
    The buying interest for silver on the New York Commodity
Exchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today to
a September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However gold
lagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late January
this year.
    Boswell said silver has been ""under-valued for so long
relative to gold but it's closing up the price gap.""
    He noted that silver last year held at the depressed level
of 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs on
concern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. ""The
strength was not filtering down to silver last year. Now
we're seeing a delayed reaction,"" the Sunshine Mining official
said.
    Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of their
largest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies,
both located in Idaho.
    Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silver
production by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mln
ounces.
    ""Low silver prices and high labor costs made it
uneconomical to keep the mines opened,"" he said.
    Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for the
loss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to
170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said.

"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens
said he will announce measures in the next few days making it
easier for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax
levied on investment income in Belgium.
    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also said he hoped
the cabinet would tomorrow approve the abolition of bourse
transaction taxes for non-residents, making Brussels one of the
few stock exchanges in the world where foreign investors were
not subjected to such a tax.
    He said both measures were aimed at attracting capital
imports, reducing Belgium's heavy net capital outflows.
    Under the present system, non-residents pay withholding tax
on their income from Belgian investments and can then reclaim
it from Belgian authorities.
    But financial analysts said the procedure for recouping the
tax is so bureaucratic and slow that it effectively acts as a
barrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in the
secondary bond market.
    Eyskens said he was ready to ""simplify and eventually
suppress"" the procedure for non-residents and would announce
details in the next few days.
    Financial analysts said the move would be far more
significant than the imminent abolition for non-residents of
the minimal bourse transaction taxes. These are set at three
rates - 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct - according to the type
of paper transacted.
    Eyskens said he hoped later to be able to abolish the
transaction taxes for residents as well, but this would depend
on progress in cutting the government's high budget deficit.
    He called the current 25 pct level of witholding tax ""much
too high"" and said he hoped to reduce it in the longer term,
perhaps as part of an overall reform of Belgian tax.
    But he added this would have to be done progressively
because of its budgetary impact. The tax raises 170 billion
francs a year in revenues, he said.
    Eyskens envisaged a cut to a basic 15 pct, after which a
rate could be set for each new security issued.
    He said that as well as aggravating net capital outflows,
the high rate of withholding tax also meant the treasury was
forced to borrow at higher interest rates.
    But he said it was politically impossible to reduce taxes
on investment income before those on earned income had been cut
as part of the tax reform, planned for late 1980s.

"The Group of Seven industrialised
countries will make use of next week's International Monetary
Fund meetings in Washington to evaluate the Paris accord on
currency stabilisation, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson told reporters.
    ""On Tuesday I shall be going to Washington for meetings of
the (IMF) Interim Committee and Development Committee, and we
shall of course be having a meeting of the G-7,"" Lawson said.
    ""And on the G-7, although there is no formal agenda, I would
imagine that the first thing we do would be to review how the
Paris accord has gone since it was agreed in February.""
    Lawson said G-7 finance ministers will be reviewing
medium-term economic objectives and projections involving
domestic and external variables. Also examined will be
performance indicators for each country.
    The Paris accord set objectives for such sectors as growth,
inflation, current account and trade balances, budget
performances, monetary conditions and exchange rates.
    Lawson said ""At both the G-7 and the Interim Committee we
will undoubtedly be discussing the debt problem. Clearly the
debt problem is still with us, and still with us in quite a big
way.""
    ""In many ways the problems of the big debtor countries, and
indeed the poorest countries, are every bit as acute as they
were when they began. It will be with us for a very long time.""
    Lawson said he knew of no new debt initiative which might
be presented and discussed next week in Washington. ""We've got
to go on a case-by-case basis,"" Lawson said.  Possibilities for
a coordinated approach to the problem would be something he
would raise within the IMF, Lawson said.
    He noted the rise this week in U.S. Short-term interest
rates, and said that a significant rise in borrowing costs
would make the debt problem more acute.
    Special attention would go to Brazil next week, but Lawson
added, ""I do not expect anything to come to a head on that.""
    Lawson said he told Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro here in February that Britain would not intervene and
press British commercial banks into giving Brazil easier
borrowing conditions. ""I told him it was a matter for the banks,
not governments,"" Lawson said.
    The IMF Interim Committee is to meet formally in Washington
next Thursday, while the Development Committee was set to

"Duff and Phelps put the outstanding
fixed income securities of of Standard Oil Co on its watch list
following the tentative offer by British Petroleum of North
America &lt;BP> to buy the company.
    Standard Oil's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debt
is currently rated DP-5 (high A) by the ratings agency.
    British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of Standard
Oil's outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder at
the tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4
billion dlrs.
    British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of that
purchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash.
    The additional debt will raise the fixed obligation ratio
of British Petroleum from under 30 pct to perhaps 45 pct and
increase its debt service requirements, Duff and Phelps said.
    However, putting Standard Oil's debt on its watch list,
which Duff and Phelps said had ""potentially negative
implications,"" may eventually result in an upgrade depending on
how British Petroleum restructures the company, Howard Mount of
the ratings agency said.
    Mount said that acquiring Standard Oil's substantial cash
flows and eliminating the annual dividend, which totaled 305
mln dlrs to common shareholders in 1986, would help satisfy
British Petroleum's higher debt service.

"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens
warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates,
calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada
Paris accord on stabilising currencies.
    The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy
convergence among major countries, he added.
    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he
believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed
""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.
    Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of
European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in
Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary
situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary
System (EMS).
    Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets,
Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more
or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements
over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury
Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker.
    Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically
influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And
Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the
yen, he said.
    But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could
reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I
think agreement is quite possible,"" he said.
     Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this
week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the
obvious negative consequences for debtor countries.
    ""It is a positive element which goes further than the
(Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of
its content,"" he said.
    He added that coordination of interest rates was a
fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence
between leading industrialised economies.
    ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation
ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a
more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said.
    Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed
in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies.
    He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which
the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange
rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a
""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins.""
    He added the meeting and the statement would have been
meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of
implementing it.
    Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among
leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order
in the international monetary system.
    ""That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods
(the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but
within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we
are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be
implemented and defended,"" he said.
    The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead
of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers
would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks.
    He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of
the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the
EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors
for strengthening the system through technical and
institutional changes.
    Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques
Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital
movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared
Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement
of the EMS. ""Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without
strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community,"" he said.

"Noranda Inc said production at its

broke out last night, trapping 44 miners and killing one.
    Noranda spokesman Denis Morin said it was impossible to
judge how long the shutdown might last but said he thought it
could be at least one week.
    The mine produced 1,792,000 tonnes of ore in 1986, Morin
said. It has a mineral inventory of 35,065,000 tonnes.
    In the mine's three zones last year, copper grade was 1.10
pct at Needle Mountain, 0.30 pct at Copper Mountain Oxide and
1.32 pct at Murdochville, Morin said.
    Another Noranda spokesman said the smelter at Murdochville,
which has not been shut down, has the capacity to treat 218,000
tonnes of mineral concentrate per year.
    The smelter treats ore from other mines as well as product
from the Murdochville facility, he said.
    The fire broke out last night in the mine which is situated
in the Gaspe district of eastern Quebec.

"The Nigerian naira firmed  against the
dollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreign
exchange auctions at the central bank were changed.
    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which
reporters were barred for the first time since the sessions
began last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with
4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.
    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation
for the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign
exchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the
rate of the lowest successful bid.
    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding
high and thus driving down the naira's value. But banking
sources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchange
remained sharply higher than the available funds.
    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,
instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer
compared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.
    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact on
bids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared with
a top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.
    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able to
pass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal rate
will only act as a marker for transactions.

"Coffee prices look set to continue
sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a
new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota
accord, according to coffee traders and analysts.
    Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows
yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when
the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed
expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be
revived at this stage, they said.
    The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents
a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.
    Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual
September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian
frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish
factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures
bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading
range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market
recovered from yesterday's ""confidence blip,"" one trader
commented.
    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower
prices in the near future, one trade source said.
    The market had become increasingly vulnerable to
yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg
second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he
said.
    Technically the market is more likely to decline further as
it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the
1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a ""three figure mentality,"" and
speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the
psychological 1,000 stg level, he added.
    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to
Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export
registrations.
     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as
no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and
light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.
    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of
support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only
possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach
of Brazil's frost season, they said.
    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting
activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not
taking up producer offers, they added.
    Central American producers have sold the bulk of their
current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and
Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,
and this could pressure prices further, traders said.
    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be
bullish, advised caution. ""Everybody's bearish now, just as they
were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,"" he said.
    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed
doubts the price spiral would continue much below current
levels. ""One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --
there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.""
    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September
1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail
prices.
    ""Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that
at this stage,"" a General Foods spokesman said.
    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in
response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the
price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65
stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to
fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.
    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in
the near future.
    ""The market seems to have established some equilibrium and
doesn't look set to go much lower,"" a Nestle spokesman
commented.
    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which
fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per
kilo for medium quality, traders added.

"Bank of Montreal &lt;BMO.M> Chairman
William Mulholland said he was reasonably optimistic that debt
negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank creditors
can be accomplished satisfactorily in the long run.
    ""It's going to be a bit rocky short term ... a couple of
months ... but I am reasonably optimistic longer term,"" he told
a press briefing here.
    Earlier, Mulholland announced that Bank of Montreal has
formally applied to swap up to 100 mln dlrs of its roughly one
billion dlr cross border exposure to Brazil into local equity
investments under a novel conversion scheme.
    Tensions have been running high between Brazil and its bank
creditors since President Jose Sarney imposed a unilateral
suspension of interest payments on some 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt on February 20, bankers said.
    Only yesterday, three leading U.S. banks voluntarily put
their Brazilian loans on non-accrual status and took a hefty
cut in net income for the first quarter ended March 31.
    Bankers saw this as a clear refusal to be intimidated into
granting major concessions as forthcoming refinancing talks.
    Bank of Montreal's Mulholland regretted Brazil's action but
declined to discuss what action his bank might take.
    Mulholland merely said that Bank of Montreal had not
canceled any of its short-term credit lines that came up for
renewal on March 31.
    However, John Bradlow, senior vice president of the
corporate and goverment banking division, said that it was
possible that Bank of Montreal might follow the U.S. banks'
lead in its second quarter results accounting.
    ""A decision will be made at April 30 or in the first weeks
of May,"" he told reporters after the briefing. Unlike most
major U.S. banks, whose reporting year ends on December 31,
Canadian banks operate on a November through October basis.
    At the press briefing, Mulholland detailed the proposed
debt/equity conversion scheme, which is aimed at boosting
investment capital and conserving foreign exchange reserves.
    Unlike many existing programs, Bank of Montreal intends to
sell its own dollar-denominated debt at par to either the
obligor or local investors for cruzados, which would then be
ploughed into Brazilian assets.
    Mulholland said current debt/equity schemes, in which bank
debt is often sold to foreign third parties at a discount, were
like ""peddling off debt at fire sale prices"". He added that
they could do pyschological harm to investor confidence.
    While acknowledging that Brazil has yet to give its
official blessing to the plan, Mulholland predicted, ""if it is
supported, we are going to see more of this.""
    Sources at other large banks with sizeable exposure to
Brazil were not so sure about the scheme's success.
    ""I don't think it's going to fly because of the impact it
would have on money supply and other political reasons,"" said
one banker, noting that earlier informal proposals along the
same lines received ""fairly neutral responses.""
    ""And is there a market for such investment in a time of
great uncertainty,"" he added.
    Mulholland admitted, ""it is something of an experiment....
some one has to screw up the courage and do something.""
    ""It is very important that avenues (to reversing net
capital outflows) are broadened,"" he added, noting that in
recent years the options have in fact been narrowing.
    Another senior banker agreed that debt/equity swap
proposals, such as Bank of Montreal's, should be explored and
developed but warned that Brasilia has been ""very ambivalent""
about debt/equity schemes thus far.
    The banker added, ""debt/equity conversion should happen but
it is not a major instrument for solving debt problems.""

"The New York Mercantile Exchange said
options on heating oil futures will begin trading June 26.
    This would be the second options contract to trade at the
exchange. NYMEX introduced crude oil options last November.
    ""Heating oil options are a logical complement to our
existing energy complex,"" said NYMEX Chairman William Bradt.
    ""From our experience in crude, we fully expect heating oil
options to offer significant new trading opportunities to
current market participants and also draw additional users into
this marketplace,"" he said.
    Six consecutive trading months in heating oil options will
be introduced on June 26, led by the September 1987 contract,
according to the exchange.
    Strike prices wil be in increments of two cts per gallon
and seven strike prices for puts and for calls will be
available, the exchange said. The middle strike price will
correspond closely to the settlement price of the previous
day's futures close, it said.
    Expiration will be on the second Friday of the month
preceding delivery of the underlying futures contract, it said,
meaning that the September options contract would expire August
14.
    Prices for heating oil options will be quoted in cts per
gallon with a minimum fluctuation of 0.01 cent per gallon,
NYMEX said.
    The options will be based on the underlying futures
contract of 42,000 gallons each. Trading hours will be the same
as heating oil futures, beginning at 0950 EST and ending 1505
EST.
    NYMEX received approval for heating oil options from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission on September 16, 1986, the
exchange said.

"Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he
made yesterday on targets for the pound as ""insignificant,""
rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched
before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said.
    They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once
again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets
set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key
international monetary talks in Washington next week.
    Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs,
virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs,
fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on
levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second
comment came.
    Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at
2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last
night's 2.9210/45.
    ""On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to
where we were before,"" Mark Brett, economist at securities house
Barclays de Zoete Wedd said.
    ""This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,"" a dealer with
a U.K. Bank commented.
    The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised
media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a
conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was.
    In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified
rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in
remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to
sell sterling.
    Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's
approximate value of the pound.
    ""The wrong end of the stick was picked up,"" he told
reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in
British exchange rate policies.
    Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements
were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative
currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was
desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues
offered about the contents of the currency accord.
    In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada
are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets,
although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid
to foster stability by keeping markets guessing.
    ""The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group
of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets
... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever
before,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett.
    Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had
changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was
targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.
     All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level
mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide
20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by
good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates.
    ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said. He expected sterling to
firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63
dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding
investments here.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his
sterling target comments so quickly.
    ""His remarks gave markets a target to aim at,"" he said,
adding, ""He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on
this ... It made him a hostage to fortune.""
    Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by
quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on
prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership
of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

"Amoco Corp first quarter profits are
expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,
reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow
said.
    Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he
said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas
prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331
mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's
first quarter.
    Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first
quarter refining and marketing results ""will look pretty poor,""
because of low margins in January and February. The margins
began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added.
    Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good
for the rest of the year, ""but it remains to be seen if they
will match 1986 levels."" The Amoco chairman said he expects
crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for
the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will
hold.
    Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is
21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would
result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration
spending.
    President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco
reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a
total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop
in oil and gas prices.
    Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that
reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices
will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the
drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from
27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve
estimate by four pct.
    Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas
liquids production to decline about five pct this year from
last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made
last year when oil prices were falling.
    He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the
purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per
day to the company's 1987 U.S. production.
    Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be
increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free
gasoline, especially the higher octane grades.
    He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor
pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline
production capacity.

"An amendment approved by the House
Agriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S.
imports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in a
comprehensive trade bill, Congressional sources said.
    The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,
would require quotas on the import of any merchandise
containing over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which are
now subject to U.S. quotas.
    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing
shipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.
However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall
jurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the
amendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.
    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal
probably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.
But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a
warning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing
plants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.
    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland and
other supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the
status of foreign trade zones.
    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on
sugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being
shipped to the United States in food products as a way to
circumvent the quota on raw sugar.
    The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year.

one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18
cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.
    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out
other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.
    ""There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of
the long-term debt market,"" he said. Both home mortgage debt
and long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates
of about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of
442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

"Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,
Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the
supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz
for national-brand ""gourmet"" coffees.
    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and
P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the
only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the
higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.
    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth
potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in
regular ground roast types.
    ""I would suspect General Foods will make a name for
themselves with their gourmet line,"" said a coffee trade
source. ""What it could do is really dent the small-store,
whole-bean business,"" the trade source added.
    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic
advertising composite--the ""yuppie"" consumer.
    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and
were ""first on their block with a wok,"" as described by Karin
Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,
called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.
    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods
subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described
its potential appeal as ""a status thing.""
    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is
expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in
small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has
just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs
for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,
according to an A and P executive.
    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has ""nothing to announce at
this point"" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does
Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and
fourth size market spot by volume with A and P.
    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of
General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market
takes off.
    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help
push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in
the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a
1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show
no signs of picking up.
    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee
quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.
    ""The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name
of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this
was quality coffee,"" Gallant said.
    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the
brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, ""they turn
around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a
Coke',"" he said.
    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have
confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are
aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd
-- the yuppie composite.
    ""Where else are you going to go?,"" an industry source said.
""Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are
no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is
gourmet,"" he said.
    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet
line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular
ground roast coffees produce.
    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of
green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of
roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting
often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell
coffee near the trade price as a ""loss leader,"" a product
designed to draw shoppers into the store.
    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing
structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade
discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a
special valve designed to keep the beans fresher.
    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green
beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet
coffee are now almost three times the price of green.
    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.
General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market
surveys for Private Collection came back for more.
    And product manager Brown points to the success of more
expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in
restricted high income areas and are now available in almost
every supermarket in the country.
    A and P is similarly optimistic. ""We think we'll do
extremely well in the gourmet market,"" Gallant said.
    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private
Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers
its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock
Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,
New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

"Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted
acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but
will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture
Department and industry commodity analysts said.
    ""The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole
supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in
balance,"" a USDA analyst said.
    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated
that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual
acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln
acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,
bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,
almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.
    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will
probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in
stocks, analysts said.
    ""It's a substantially different story from last year when
we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,"" Vernon
McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.
    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,
McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely
translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,
final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.
    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in
1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting
in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile
of 5.45 billion bushels.
    ""To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're
at least in a holding pattern,"" George Hoffman, director of
commodity analysis for Pillsbury said.
    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of
1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to ""significantly less""
domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.
    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and
said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not
increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next
year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.
    ""We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,
so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage
reductions, that would be an improvement,"" an Agriculture
Department wheat analyst said.
    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the
smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower
final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to
100 mln bushels, analysts said.
    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the
conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs
will be more effective because they will force more high
producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.
    ""We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long
tunnel,"" the analyst said.

"President Alan Garcia said he sought to
deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by
limiting repayments to the World Bank.
    In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World
Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount
the bank is willing to make in new loans. ""We will deepen our
policy on the foreign debt,"" he said.
    Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of
export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due
foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally
been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on
payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank.
    But tonight Garcia said: ""We have met our aim of limiting
the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though
organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us
to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types
of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars
than that which they are willing to newly lend us.""
    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank
about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr
debt.
    Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin
America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line
on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.
    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage
to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage
workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.
    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants
and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but
not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1,
1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per
U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the
year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.
    Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue
earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes.
Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up,
he said, without specifying the amount.
    Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians
to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct
premium above the market exchange rate.
    The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is
14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.
    To encourage private investment, he said the government
would set up a special fund with which it would match every two
intis of private investment with one inti from the government.
    He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander
Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday
strengthened the democratic authority of his government.

"Oil output in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05
mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer
resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources
said.
    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy
Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a
barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72
dlrs.
    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE
producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of
800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.
    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from
around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a
mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the
sources added.
    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif
and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed
prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.
    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese
term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they
added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it
Murban.
    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on
stream in 1983, to be test production not included in
calculations for complying with the OPEC quota.
    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its
quota in March, the sources added.

"An extension of the International Tin
Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed
to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told
reporters.
    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of
the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said
Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look
into how to replace the pact.
    But he said that given the present disagreement between
producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up
to the ITA.
    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension
of the ITA, he said, ""No one will propose that. It's also
unrealistic to do so.""
    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the
seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to
introduce a quota system which limited their exports and
consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.
    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.

    He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its

firm slightly in the third quarter of the year.
    He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members
will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and
seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so
that members could produce more in the third and fourth
quarters of 1987.

"The failure of the Bangladesh government
to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a

Zia, told a press conference yesterday.
    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country
in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat
sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.

"The U.S. Administration, under
Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urge
Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to
stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading
industrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said.
    The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the
1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the
Paris Accord are more binding, they said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect
U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast
enough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to
bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the
meeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, the
sources said.
    ""The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to
announce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan and
for the exchange markets in general,"" one of the sources said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, in
which West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will be
renewed by the industrial countries this week.
    Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven
will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made
setting up stimulus measures.
    The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further
substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with
Congress this year, the sources said.
    Washington would like its economic partners to establish
specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set
objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on
appropriate corrective action, they added.
    The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and
West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports
and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing its
demand for imports.
    But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be
far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck,
the sources said.
    Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall
against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over
semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain
Japanese electronic goods.
    One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent
soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings.
    Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed
particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said.

Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.
    It was the second production sharing contract signed by
Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.
    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence
of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil
production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.
    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln

years.
    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil
producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said
there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.
    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled
before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding
blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now

    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract
Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.
    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's
favour with operational costs deducted.
    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's
production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest
in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds
oil.
    Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for

"Japanese oil traders generally expect oil
prices to remain steady through June, when the next
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting
is scheduled to take place.
    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a
month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February
as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly
resist paying official prices, trade sources said.
    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to
stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.
    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,
mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its
15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members
would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.
    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output
targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.
    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to
demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting
from Japanese buyers.
    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels
to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.
    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its
ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd
compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East
Economic Survey estimated.
    ""Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to
destroy the market,"" an oil trader in Tokyo said.
    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at
discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of
Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have
not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.
    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20
to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude
under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be
weaker, traders said.
    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today
OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output
volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or
raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in

dlrs.
    A Minas de Almaden statement said the non-communist world's
main mercury producers had decided not to sign any contracts
using the reference price of specialist publications, because
it was well below their costs of production.

"A top Japanese businessman said the
country's four largest economic organizations will soon present
to the government a set of proposals to expand domestic demand.
    Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), told a news conference the
government should draw up a package of economic measures
totalling more than 5,000 billion yen.
    Saito said the government's package should include plans to
remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products
and to lift tariffs on industrial products.
    Leading industrialised countries should also step up
concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates,
Saito said.
    The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation
of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic
Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Saito said Japan should stop paying only lip service to its
pledges to open its markets.
    The proposed measures should be undertaken by increased
fiscal spending, he added.

"Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said
he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market
because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a
price of 18 dlrs a barrel.
    ""We are very confident that things will continue this way.
The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution
of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price,"" he said at a signing
ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement.
    He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its
agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to
firm slightly in the third quarter of the year.
    He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members
will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and
seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so
that members could produce more in the third and fourth

"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but
warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market
liberalisation efforts falter or fail.
    In a press conference after talks with South Korean
leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention
to regulate exports and boost imports ""a very, very important
step, the right direction for the Korean government to take.""
    The government adopted the new policies last week in the
hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.
    Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the
fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by
exports alone.""
    ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth
begins to take more of the load,"" he said.
    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with
Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and
consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion
dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.
    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough
and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for
liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if
the government is willing to follow through.""
    ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy
direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism
growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not
keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing
liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn
backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see
protectionist movement in the U.S.""
    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha
Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific
product categories.
    These included service industries, which he said were still
too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and
cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the
tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them
sell for up to three times their American prices.
    ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's
going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are
just pointing this out.""
    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a
revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for
months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target
for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies
around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world
economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various
economies involved,"" he said.
    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for
cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in
third countries. The American government would be pleased to
encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.
    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase
tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said
Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to
its difficulties with South Korea.
    ""I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,""
he said. ""It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for
nothing or just by asking for it.
    ""But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they
usually end up with something good happening at the end that
both countries live up to.""

"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will
not change its decision to admit China as a member despite
protests from founder member Taiwan, bank president Masao
Fujioka said.
    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the
bank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused a
Taiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.
    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been
invited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in
Osaka, ""but the situation remains the same.""
    ""The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,
China',"" Fujioka said.
    ""We have tried to maintain our channels of communication
through the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating with
a view to changing our agreement with China,"" he said.
    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among
the bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.
    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, which
complained at last year's meeting that for several years the
ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.
    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was
made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.
    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan
were disbursed.
    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for
Vietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only one
was under administration at the end of 1986.
    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986
totalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount of
effective loans, the report said.
    ""The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank
operations,"" Fujioka said. ""Vietnam continues to be a member. We
would like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult.""
    ""It's not a question of political instability, the
environment has to be right for banking operations.""
    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, and
lending operations in China scheduled to start this year, the
ADB had now acquired a ""truly Asian"" character.
    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of
experience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would be
routed through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.
    ""It's been a very slow start,"" Fujioka said. ""We identified
three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only
two left.""
    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln
dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.
    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.
    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250
mln dlrs.
    ""There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should
be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,""
Fujioka said. He did not give details.
    Fujioka said the ADB saw its lending to the private sector
serving as a catalyst. The bank's new private sector division
in 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs without
government guarantees.
    In addition, the ADB approved four equity investment
projects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs. This raised to 15.18 mln the
cumulative approvals since equity financing commenced in 1983.
    But Fujioka said the ADB should not compete with private
banks. ""We have a narrow path to walk,"" he said.
    He said he was happy with the decision of the bank's donor
countries to increase the ADB's fund for soft loans.
    The fourth replenishment of the soft-loan window, the Asian
Development Fund , brought it to 3.6 billion dlrs, from 3.2
billion, Fujioka said. In particular the United States has
maintained its 16 pct share,"" said the ADB chief.
    He said there had been disagreements with the U.S., Which
holds 14.9 pct of the bank's equity, over lending policies. The
U.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in its
impatience to hit lending targets.
    ""I suspect there is some arm-twisting,"" he said.
    ""I find some developed countries are more interested in the
procurement side instead of the development side.""
    Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lending
and a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending.
    Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pct
of total loans in 1987, from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in
1985. He said sectoral lending was projected to rise to 20 pct
in 1987, from 12.8 pct in 1986 and 7.5 pct in 1985.
    He said the bank would try to reduce some of its liquid
assets by repaying borrowings carrying high interest rates.
    ""On the other hand we must maintain our presence in major
financial markets,"" he said. ""Why should we not take advantage of
historically low interest rates?""

"Australian coal industry sources said
Japanese electricity utilities are demanding price cuts in
annual coal contract negotiations underway in Tokyo.
    But the sources said they were unable to substantiate
reports here that one of the largest steaming coal customers
&lt;Chugoku Electric Power Co Inc> threatened to stop taking
deliveries until new prices are set.
    Coal exporters want to maintain last year's 32 U.S. Dlrs a
tonne price, which expired at the end of Japan's fiscal year on
March 31, while the Japanese want to pay no more than the 27-28
U.S. Dlrs secured with China and South Africa.
    Ross McKinnon, general manager of &lt;Thiess Dampier Mitsui
Coal Pty Ltd>, which annually exports about one mln tonnes of
steaming coal to Japan, mainly to Chugoku, told Reuters he had
not been informed of any refusal to take shipments.
    McKinnon said he could not recall when a Japanese contract
had been settled before the previous one had expired, and said
""controlled leaks"" were commonplace during talks.
    But Australian foreign currency markets took the reports
seriously enough for dealers to say it added nervousness to
trading, with the local dollar settling on 0.7080 U.S. Cents at
midsession against its 0.7120 opening.
    Coal was Australia's largest single export in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1986 with shipments reaching 90.49 mln
tonnes worth 5.21 billion dlrs, or 15.9 pct of total exports.
    Japan is the largest customer for the crucial steaming coal
sector and took 14.97 mln tonnes of total exports of 43.3 mln
tonnes in calendar 1986.
    Sydney resources analyst Ian Story said the appreciation of
the Australian dollar against the U.S. Currency meant steaming
coal exporters were now receiving just 44.72 dlrs a tonne
against 52.42 dlrs when last year's contract was negotiated.

"Asian countries are offering better oil
exploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to
last year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.
    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price
fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which
found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.
    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8
billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated
to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled
in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.
    The report said &lt;Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co
Ltd>, a unit of the &lt;Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30
pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.
    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced
petroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.
    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct
to cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its
12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional
exporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.
Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in
1986 from 40 billion the previous year.
    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986
from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.
    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,
China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.
    However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine
billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased
their balance of payments.
    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan
were major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan
respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year.

"Japan's policy of self-sufficiency in
rice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S.
Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference.
    He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan
had a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But with
other countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct
self-sufficient in one product.
    Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture
minister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for
total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.
    Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.
    ""We want to have some access in the rice market,"" he said.
    He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter
were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told
reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open
negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan
on rice.
    Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice
self-sufficiency.
    Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue,
Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Rice
industry would do.
    Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August
this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the
U.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the
meantime.
    U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they would

ban.

"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand
that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an
explosive situation and protectionist legislation.
    Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said
protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly
during the last six months.
    ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.
We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory
laws which would have very serious consequences for other
countries, especially Japan,"" Lyng told reporters.
    Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation
appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,
requiring retaliation against countries which have trade
surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.
    U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington
Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the
Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade
legislation is taken up later this month.
    Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the
volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is
increasingly unpredictable, he said.
    ""The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that
patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I
cannot emphasise that enough,"" Lyng said.
    In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato
yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked
Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import
quotas on beef and citrus.
    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.
Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response
in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been
introduced in both the House and Senate.
    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for
exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm
products since 1964, especially grains.
    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land

"The World Bank has suggested India
should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most
government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external
trade policy with reduced levels of protection.
    A confidential ""executive summary"" of a draft Bank report on
the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests
liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports
of Indian goods by making them more competitive.
    The summary said, ""These reforms would result in (domestic)
prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,
and in a greater degree of import competition and export
rivalry than the nation has ever seen.""
    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in
India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal
imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and
expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports
would provide the foreign exchange for imports.
    ""The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present
principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously
available products and to recognise the role of actual or
potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on
the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic
manufacturers,"" the summary said.
    An Indian official told Reuters the government was
discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some
changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give
further details.
    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's
final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss
aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.
    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew
at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and
1986/87, which ended in March.
    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of
gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by
national savings, mainly from the private sector.
    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed
to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to
2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.
    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to
lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers
which make up the bulk of India's import bill.
    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign
exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the
summary said.
    The Bank's summary said there was little room for
complacency in the balance of payments position.
    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,
Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.
    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a
year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable
balance of payments, the summary said.
    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.
India ""might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while
undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that
involve some political costs,"" it said.
    ""An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an
exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,""
the summary said.
    It said such an approach had been successful in countries
such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the
competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce
import pressures.
    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the
World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost
exports.

"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but
warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market
liberalisation efforts falter or fail.
    In a press conference after talks with South Korean
leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention
to regulate exports and boost imports ""a very, very important
step, the right direction for the Korean government to take.""
    The government adopted the new policies last week in the
hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.
    Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the
fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by
exports alone.""
    ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth
begins to take more of the load,"" he said.
    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with
Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and
consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion
dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.
    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough
and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for
liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if
the government is willing to follow through.""
    ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy
direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism
growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not
keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing
liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn
backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see
protectionist movement in the U.S.""
    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha
Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific
product categories.
    These included service industries, which he said were still
too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and
cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the
tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them
sell for up to three times their American prices.
    ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's
going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are
just pointing this out.""
    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a
revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for
months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target
for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies
around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world
economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various
economies involved,"" he said.
    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for
cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in
third countries. The American government would be pleased to
encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.
    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase
tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said
Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to
its difficulties with South Korea.
    ""I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,""
he said. ""It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for
nothing or just by asking for it.
    ""But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they
usually end up with something good happening at the end that
both countries live up to.""

"A black policeman was killed and
70 were injured when a bomb was lobbed onto a parade ground in
South Africa's biggest black township of Soweto this morning,
the government said.
    The device was thrown from a passing vehicle as trainee
township policemen from all over South Africa were on parade at
the Tladi police training centre, the government's Bureau for
Information said.
    Ten officers were seriously wounded and 60 suffered slight
injuries, it said.
    A bureau spokesman said the type of explosive device used
was not known and no arrests had been made.
    The government has blamed a spate of limpet mine blasts in
South African cities in recent months on the outlawed African
National Congress (ANC), fighting a low-level guerrilla war
against white domination in South Africa.
    The municipal police, who perform security duties in black
townships, have been a main target of black militants in the
past three years of political unrest which has claimed some
2,400 lives.
    Many black policemen have been forced to live in compounds
on the outskirts of townships after their homes were attacked.
    Today's attack, one of the most daring since a national
state of emergency was declared last June, came as police and
troops deployed at railway stations to stop attacks on trains
linked to a bitter strike by black transport workers.
    Foreign Minister Pik Botha has alleged that the ANC is
planning a campaign of violence in the run-up to the
whites-only general election next month. Security is a major
election issue, with extreme right-wingers accusing the
government of being soft in the face of a ""revolutionary
onslaught.""
    Botha warned neighbouring black-ruled states not to allow
the guerrillas to infiltrate South Africa through their
territory. He said South Africa would not hesitate to take
action to thwart the alleged offensive.
    Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe denied Botha's
charges and said they were a pretext for South African attacks
on them. Pretoria has raided alleged ANC bases in the so-called
Frontline states in the past.

"British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe called on industrial and developing countries to combat
trade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free
trading in agricultural products.
    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting
protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30
pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.
    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,
remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide
protection for intellectual property rights.
    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic
policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable
currency relationships.
    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses
and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over
subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm
surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is
politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend
of growing farm subsidies.
    ""This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of
agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the
sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to
find solutions,"" Howe said.

"Taiwan's Economic Ministry has approved
an ambitious proposal calling for a one billion U.S. Dollar
investment by private and public companies in the United States
over the next five years, ministry officials said.
    John Ni, director of the Ministry's Industrial Development
and Investment Centre (IDIC), said under the IDIC proposal,
Taiwanese firms would be encouraged to set up factories and
invest in property and securities markets in the U.S..
    Taiwan's 1986 investment in the U.S. Totalled 46 mln U.S.
Dlrs, official statistics show.
    The investment was mainly in the electronics, food, service
and trading sectors.
    The new proposal, approved by Economic Minister Lee Ta-hai
yesterday, calls for investment of 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in 1987,
120 mln in 1988, 160 mln in 1989, 240 mln in 1990 and 400 mln
in 1991, he told Reuters.
    It will be discussed soon by officials of the Finance
Ministry, the Central Bank and the Council for Economic
Planning and Development before being submitted to the cabinet
for final approval, he said.
    ""This is the first ambitious proposal with government
initiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,""
Lee said.
    He said government incentives to prospective Taiwanese
investors would include bank loans and a five-year income tax
holiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also be
simplified.
    A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investment
would be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americans
and avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwanese
products.
    The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with
the U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.
    The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54
billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves.
    Economists described the proposal as a significant step by
the government to head off U.S. Protectionism.
    ""Time is running out for us. Taiwan has lagged far behind
Japan and South Korea in encouraging its businessmen to invest
abroad,"" said Hou Chia-chi, economics professor at Soochow

"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will
not change its decision to admit China as a member despite
protests from founder member Taiwan, bank president Masao
Fujioka said.
    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the
bank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused a
Taiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.
    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been
invited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in
Osaka, ""but the situation remains the same.""
    ""The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,
China',"" Fujioka said.
    ""We have tried to maintain our channels of communication
through the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating with
a view to changing our agreement with China,"" he said.
    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among
the bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.
    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, which
complained at last year's meeting that for several years the
ADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.
    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was
made to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.
    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan
were disbursed.
    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for
Vietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only one
was under administration at the end of 1986.
    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986
totalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount of
effective loans, the report said.
    ""The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank
operations,"" Fujioka said. ""Vietnam continues to be a member. We
would like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult.""
    ""It's not a question of political instability, the
environment has to be right for banking operations.""
    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, and
lending operations in China scheduled to start this year, the
ADB had now acquired a ""truly Asian"" character.
    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of
experience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would be
routed through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.
    ""It's been a very slow start,"" Fujioka said. ""We identified
three projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only
two left.""
    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln
dlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.
    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.
    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250
mln dlrs.
    ""There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should
be modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,""
Fujioka said. He did not give details.

"Taiwan's industrial production index,
base 1981, rose 14.21 pct to 162.19 in March from a revised
142.01 in February, and 7.19 pct from March 1986, the Economic

    A ministry official said the March index stood at its

"U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
said there was a one in five chance that new drilling in Alaska
would find oil.
    ""But if it's there, there's a very good chance that it would
be a giant field,"" Hodel said on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
    ""So it is the best geological prospect that they
(geologists) have talked to me about since I've been involved
in this process,"" he said.
    Hodel announced yesterday that he would urge Congress to
open up 1.5 mln acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska to oil exploration despite fears of environmental damage
threatening the Caribou herd in the region.
    He said today the exploration was needed in an effort to
prevent future U.S. oil shortages and said oil drilling in the
large Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska proved oil could be drilled
without severely damaging the environment.
    He said the Caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay had tripled,
contrary to concerns before the drilling operation that it
would endanger the herd.

"U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said U.S. Sales of high technology to China are rising despite
Peking's complaints they are being restricted.
    He told reporters at the airport on arriving here for talks
that technology transfers to China had increased every year and
would continue to do so.
    The official Peking Review yesterday accused the United
States of delaying approval on high-technology sales to China.
    Last year, Washington approved only 60 pct of the exports
China applied for, the magazine said.
    ""The COCOM-listed kind of export controls are just a
fraction of the technology that the U.S. Is transferring (to
China) by other means, such as joint ventures,"" Baldrige said.
    COCOM is the Western coordinating committee formed after
World War Two to limit the export of advanced technology to
Communist nations.
    Baldrige said he was sure U.S. Firms could compete against
firms from other countries for high technology sales.
    He added that protectionism would hurt the economies of
trading nations and said the Reagan Administration would fight
protectionist legislation in the U.S. Congress.
    Baldrige and China's Foreign Trade Minister Zheng Tuobin
will act as chairmen of the fifth session of a commission on
commerce and trade that will review bilateral trade relations.
    A U.S. Official said other issues to be raised during
Baldrige's talks are trade deficits, which each country says it
has with the other, and the problems facing U.S. Companies
investing in China.

"The Japanese government is considering
buying U.S.-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting trade
friction between the two countries, Trade Minister Hajime
Tamura was quoting as saying.
    Japanese officials said Tamura told visiting U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter that the government may set
aside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in a
supplementary budget to be drawn up later this year.
    But he emphasised that the matter was still under study and
that no firm decision had been made.
    Tamura urged Yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposed
against Japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was already
working to correct the country's trade imbalance.
    But, according to Japanese officials, Yeutter held out
little hope that the American trade sanctions would be lifted
soon and said the United States needed action from Japan to
boost its domestic demand and imports, not just words.
    In order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worth
of Japanese exports last Friday, the U.S. Needs proof that its

"Japan is faced with a mounting crisis
over its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must act
more quickly to refocus its export driven economy, a senior
Foreign Ministry official said.
    ""The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well as
the government is increasing,"" Deputy Director General Hiroshi
Hirabayashi told reporters. ""The need to accelerate the efforts
(to restructure the economy) is well recognized.""
    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made to
refocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might not
seem all that spectacular to foreign observers.
    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing the
so-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, he
said. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate the
efforts that have been made.
    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank of
Japan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan's
economy away from its dependence on exports for growth. The
Japanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its
release.
    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
told his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction
set out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve
it.
    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had
been done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus
its economy.
    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports of
manufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,
and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.
    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the
future to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that
it would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.
    ""It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set
out by the Maekawa report,"" he said.

"The Supreme Court, in a 6-3
decision, ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protecting
companies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses is
constitutional.
    The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Court
of Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-share
acquisition law.
    The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corp
of America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.
    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million shares
to bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company's
total.
   
    After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the measure.
    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on the
tender offer at the option of the target company.
    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares in
an Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless a
majority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at their
next regularly scheduled meeting.
    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, held
that the state law was not pre-empted by federal securities
law.
   
    ""The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from the
coercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as a
group,"" he said.
    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offers

"The State of New Jersey said that it
sold 23 stocks in a program trade worth 43 mln dlrs this
morning.
    Roland Machold, director of the Division of Investment for
the state of New Jersey, said, ""the sale was part of our
ongoing divestment program.""
    Under N.J. state law enacted in August 1985, the state must
divest all securities, stocks and bonds, of companies that do
business in, or with South Africa by August 1988, Machold said.
    He said ""in order to be fully divested by August 1988, we
will probably have to sell an average every week of between 50
mln and 75 mln dlrs of stock.""
    The stocks sold in today's program sale include Abbott
Laboratories &lt;ABT>, Allied Signal Inc &lt;ALD>, CitiCorp &lt;CCI>,
Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, General Motors &lt;GM>, Gillette Co &lt;GS>, H.J.

    Machold said that one brokerage house handled today's sale
but seven houses bid on the deal. He would not disclose the
brokerage house that handled the sale.
    ""The total value of the sales to date,"" Machold said, ""are
about three billion dlrs in book value and about four billion
dlrs in market value.""
    He said that because of the difficulty of defining
companies that do business with South Africa, it is difficult
to determine exactly how much future sales will be worth.
Machold estimated the book value of future sales to August 1988
will be in the range of 1.2 billion dlrs to 5.2 billion dlrs.

"Falconbridge Ltd said it expected
results for the rest of 1987 to improve from the earlier
reported first quarter operating loss of 15.4 mln dlrs.
    Chief executive William James told reporters after the
annual meeting that ""I would hope that the loss for the year
certainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter.
In other words we are going to make money from here on in.""
    Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating loss
of 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mln
dlrs.
    James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadian
dollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarter
operating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accounts
receivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent
decreasing as the U.S. dollar falls.
    He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker
nickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the
company's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd
Creek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production
through the rest of the year and higher average prices this
year for precious metals, James added, without elaborating.
    Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further
divestments, James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The
company sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay
down debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek
Mines Ltd from Canada Development Corp &lt;CDC.TO>.
    He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion
dlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek
buy.
    James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp
&lt;AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>. Dome's
23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge.
    Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Dome
bidder, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd to
Chicago-based Amoco, James replied, ""It makes no difference to
me...whoever takes it over is fine by us.""
    He told shareholders that Falconbridges' planned capital
expenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160
mln dlrs last year.

"Quantum Fund N.V., a Netherlands
Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros
is investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit further
purchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.
    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
Quantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.
    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could ""impair"" the government security clearances Fairchild
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not
make ""significant additional purchases"" of its common or
preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.
    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.
    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
Fairchild at this time.
    The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     Fairchild's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be
held tomorrow.

"Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last
year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary
policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said.
    ""There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money
in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in
interest bearing investments which have no direct productive
outlet,"" one banker said.
    Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market
rate and abandoned another which had been used since February
1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs.
    The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at
which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the
inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates.
    The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of
interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor
Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive
the economy.
    One banker said ""There is growing flexibility, creativity,
in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to
diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector.""
    For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest
rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a
favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the
past, banking sources said.
    Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran-
Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the
prospect of any significant capital flight.
    The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank
and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger
now than for several years.
    Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second
thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching
funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said.
    ""There is a distinct exchange rate risk,"" they added.
    Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind
the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18
pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping in the Gulf.
    The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against
a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact
make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar.
    Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond
0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting
funds into the U.S. Currency. ""They may ask:When will the dollar
be so cheap again?"" one said.
    And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below
those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a
delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility.
    Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy
is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment
and strengthen the backbone of the economy.
    They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and
allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct
contraction the previous year.
    Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock
market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees

"Congress returned from its Easter
recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises
to be a partisan dispute.
    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan
and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the
Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is
taking on new prominence because of current trade woes.
    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge
deficits are said to be at the root of related international
trade friction currently worrying financiers.
    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock
exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United
States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade
war between the two trading giants for the first time since
World War II.
    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is
refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the
resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions
and small computers.
    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither
side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.
    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to
the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to
grow without repercussions.
    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by
foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they
withdraw this support the result can only be further problems,
including higher interest rates for Americans.
    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the
showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar
spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,
was trounced badly in the House on April 9.
    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the
House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171
billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through
defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs
in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up
its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be
passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.
    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,
which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's
Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate
Budget Committee for full Senate consideration.
    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he
believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design
among congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit
approval of the White House.
    ""Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax
hikes and defense cuts,"" he said.
    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press
for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with
Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But ""it is not
clear how the Republicans will act,"" he added.
    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower
taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after
Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.
     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited
what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound
up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.
    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,
critics note that his administration's record of accumulated
debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion
dlrs.
    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and
many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused
the worst U.S. trade deficit ever.
     Last year the United States bought goods from the world
worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including
purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.
    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one
front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory
measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far
against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.
    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the
deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7
billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.
    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law
enacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do
more than talk about deficits.
    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of
Texas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991
through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.
    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement
mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if
Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.
    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But
in reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,
Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target
of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the
numbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion
dlrs -- far off the target.
    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is
expected to be missed widely.

"Spanish Secretary of State for the
economy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintained
its five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pct
increase in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumer
price index to 6.3 pct.
    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by the
National Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactory
but acceptable.
    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.
Prices rose 8.3 pct last year.
    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting an
error in last January's consumer price index. Economists had
earlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.
    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed
the index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in
April.
    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March
price rise showed inflation was going up again and the
government looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct
target.
    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled
unions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's
recomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.
    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes
for wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so
far this year have yielded average increases upwards of six
pct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct.

"The Swiss National Bank will continue to
take part in concerted intervention on currency markets as
necessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual
meeting.
    He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which
bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation
between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it
breaching thresholds that would damage everyone.
    ""We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take
part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is
possible and desirable,"" Languetin said.
    Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the
six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in
February, adding that it had anchored the principle of
strengthened international cooperation.
    He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were
useful in the short term.
    But he added, ""The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no
lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental
imbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficit
and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan.""
    Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary
in the ""too expansive"" monetary policy of the United States,
adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply
was expanding too strongly.
    ""If this should last long the dollar could only be
stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary
policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in
turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,""
he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in
the most important countries had not relinquished their
anti-inflation policies.

"Several Japanese buyers have accepted
postponement of between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of Cuban raw
sugar scheduled for delivery in calendar 1987 until next year
following a request from Cuba, trade sources said.
    Cuba had sought delays for some 300,000 tonnes of
deliveries, they said. It made a similar request in January
when Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200,000 tonnes of
sugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988.
    Some buyers rejected the Cuban request because they have
already sold the sugar on to refiners, they added.
    Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some
950,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment.
    But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likely
to total only some 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes this year, against
576,990 in 1986, reflecting both the postponements and sales
earlier this year by Japanese traders of an estimated 150,000
tonnes of Cuban sugar to the USSR for 1987 shipment, they said.

"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
unpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellow
politicians and political analysts agree he has suffered a
grave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off.
    Michio Watanabe, a Nakasone faction member and deputy
secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, LDP,
is one of those who believes he will survive.
    ""He's tough, he won't step down,"" but ""will hang on to the
death"" at least until his term ends on October 30, Watanabe told
Reuters.
    The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone's plans to
revamp the nation's tax system for the first time in 36 years.
Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a
mistake.
    ""It was too greedy,"" he said. A two or three pct tariff might
have been easier to swallow, he said.
    One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts is
that Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June
8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice.
    A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that
Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister. But he would
not bet on his chances of survival up until October.
    Masamichi Inoki, a senior fellow at the conservative
Institute of Peace and Security, said he did not think Nakasone
had suffered irreparable damage.
    ""He will certainly hang on for the summit,"" Inoki said.
    In any event, the general belief now is that the five pct
sales tax, as championed by Nakasone, is a dead issue but that
an indirect tax, in another form, will be introduced by the
LDP.
    Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected as
early as the next Diet (parliament) meets. The current session
finishes on May 27.
    The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of
opinion, stating that Nakasone might well get another year to
deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform.
    The government has to find a way of generating revenue to
support an expected glut of elderly Japanese.
    And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an
indirect tax, said Watanabe, a former Minister of International
Trade and Industry.
    The next prime minister will have to grapple with an
indirect tax, and ""whoever is the next prime minister won't be
in the job very long,"" Watanabe said.
    Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would be
any of the three so-called ""New Leaders,"" LDP secretary general
Noboru Takeshita, LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe,
and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Each of them controls a

    ""Soon after the Venice summit, there will be a move to

    ""He can't fight on,"" he said.
    He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to the
sales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan's
purge of policies inherited from the U.S. Occupation.
    Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied, but
""to introduce such a tax, they'll have to change the prime

    Nevertheless, Shiratori said he believes Nakasone could
hang on until as late as September.

"Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
curbing capital outflows.
    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
not that good, he said.
    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it

"Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised and
extended their textile export agreement after negotiations in
Washington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile
Federation said.
    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord
has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has
agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile
and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,
he said. ""The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space
to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to
other nations,"" he added.
    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar
textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But
despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals
in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan
dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against
the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose
by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.
    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8
billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of
7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same
this year, Chen said.

"Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost
imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to
Washington next week, LDP officials said.
    The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more
than 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget for
the current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration of
more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first
half of the year, they said.
    Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials during
his visit to Washington starting April 29.

    The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of
pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May.
    The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade
surplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth
led by domestic demand, officials said.
    The government was also urged to review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. The
government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in
the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of
fiscal reforms.

    The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of
foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods
by improving import financing, and to make clear official
procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers.
    The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to
society at large through measures such as doubling its official
development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or so
instead of seven years as the government had originally
promised.
    The government was urged to work out a program to recycle
funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.

    The officials said the funds to be recycled would include
those from the private sector and others provided through the
government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund.
    The plan also calls for the government to take steps to
help the development of African and other less developed
nations.
    The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of
monetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on deposits
with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund, and a tax cut to
promote plant and equipment investment.

    Shell Canada reported first quarter earnings of 103 mln

share.
    Oil products earnings were 38 mln dlrs, up 19 mln dlrs from
last year, when margins were impaired by lower oil prices.
    Shell Canada said chemical earnings were 17 mln dlrs in the
quarter, compared with a loss of five mln dlrs in 1986. The
styrene business saw significant improvement, stemming from an
increase in international demand.
    Resources earnings increased by six mln dlrs to 46 mln
dlrs. Lower prices for all commodities were offset by the
removal of the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax, the impact of
lower royalty rates and higher volumes.

11,200 cubic meters a day, Shell said.
    Shell Canada also said natural gas sales volumes of 19.6

    The company also recorded benefits of 10 mln dlrs from the

"The visit this week by a special
Japanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade
frictions with the United States, U.S. and congressional
leaders say.
    White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see
stance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for the
April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.

    They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, with
one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy
and open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it was
time now for action.
    The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billion
dlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan.
    Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try
to turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S.
jobs and closed thousands of factories.
    Much of the anger has been directed at Japan.
    U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President
Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair
practices in semiconductor trade.
    Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers,
television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
less than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.
 
    Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S.
officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had
shown it was honoring the pact, which could take several
months.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone's
visit might help to defuse trade tensions, said ""whether
progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it.""
    He added, ""I would expect progress to be made. If you want
to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's more
doubtful.""
    Congressmen were equally skeptical.
    Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade
legislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic
spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide
range of goods, including supercomputers and farm products.
    Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after the
meeting, ""We have heard promises in the past, but the question
now is whether there will be real action.""
    Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill,
including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat.
    Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with
large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices.
    Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan,
South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass the
House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its
fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisan
group of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter released
as Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S.
trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon
opened to American goods.
    The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others
ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues.
    They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentiment
that Japan was fighting opening its markets and ""evidence to the
contrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it is
likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off
the American market to Japanese goods.

growth that ""is not sustainable nor equitable to our other major

"The growth of the Swiss
economy will likely slow to 2.2 pct this year and 1.9 pct in
1988 after reaching 2.8 pct last year, according to a study by
a group at Basle University's Institute of Applied Economics.
    It blamed the expected slowdown partly on a disappointing
outlook for exports caused by the weaker dollar. Exports would
likely grow by 2.8 pct this year and by 3.0 pct in 1988, after
3.0 pct in 1986, the group predicted.
    Final domestic demand will also fall back, to a likely 3.0
pct this year and 2.3 pct next, after 4.1 pct in 1986. However,
the domestic picture will likely be mixed.
    The study said investment in plant and equipment would
continue to be the main motor for the growth in domestic
demand, although it was unlikely to grow as fast as last year's
7.4 pct, rising this year by 4.5 pct and by 2.8 pct in 1988.
    While the growth in private consumption is expected to fall
back to 2.5 pct this year and 2.1 pct in 1988 from last year's
3.1 pct, public consumption spending will likely grow by 1.9
pct in 1987 and 2.0 pct next year, after 1.5 pct in 1986.
    Consumer prices were seen rising by 1.7 pct this year and
2.4 pct in 1988, after just 0.8 pct in 1986. Unemployment
should fall back to 0.7 pct from last year's 0.8 pct.

"General Motors Corp's &lt;GM> Bedford
Trucks subsidiary has signed a memorandum of understanding with
its affiliate Isuzu Motors Ltd &lt;ISUM.T> to negotiate a van
manufacturing joint venture in the U.K.
    The proposals would involve doubling output at the loss
making plant at Luton in southern England to around 40,000 vans
a year by 1990.
     Bedford, faced with reduced demand for heavy trucks in the
last few years, stopped most of its heavy truck production at
the end of 1986. GM would have a 60 pct stake in the venture
and Izuzu 40 pct
    GM holds a 38.6 pct stake in Isuzu.
    Bedford already has a link with Izuzu under which it
assembles some smaller Japanese vehicles in Britain.
    A Bedford spokesman said financial details of the deal had
not yet been finalised although it was anticipated that the
venture would start without debt.
    Currently the Luton van plant was estimated to be losing
some 500,000 stg a week, he added.
    Bedford's other truck plant, which manufactures military
vehicles and trucks in kit form for export, was not involved in
the venture.
    Analysts said the deal was another attempt by U.K. Truck
manufacturers to restructure operations and cope with heavy
losses and low demand that have hit the market over the past
few years.
    In February, state-owned Rover Group Plc &lt;BLLL.L> formed a
joint venture with &lt;Van Doorne's Bedrijswagenfabriek Daf BV>
for truck manufacture, with Daf owning 60 pct.

"Exxon Corp reported a 37 pct drop in
first quarter profits to 1.07 billion dlrs citing lower oil and
gas prices.
    The company said profits in the lastest quarter included a
26 mln drl restructuring gain from divestment of certain gold
operations overseas, while last year's first quarter profit of
1.71 billion dlrs included the initial charge of 235 mln dlrs
for its 1986 corporate reorganization.
    First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billion
dlrs.
   
    One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter results
were stronger than 1986's final quarter which included several
large asset sales and positive inventory adjustments.
    It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting the
company's continued purchases of its own common for the
treasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares were
acquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in
1986's fourth quarter.
    Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oil
prices strengthened moderately within the quarter and were
higher than a year ago at the end of the quarter.
   
    However, average crude prices for the quarter were below
the year ago period, leading to lower earnings for exploration
and production operations, Exxon said.
    Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower natural
gas prices, primarily overseas, representing contract
adjustments representing contract adjustments tied to falling
product prices in 1986, the company said.
    During the first quarter, the company said, intense
competition in both domestic and international markets served
to depress margins for refined products.
   
    Exxon said the lower product margins resulted in
significantly reduced earnings for refining and marketing
operations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strong
margins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986.
    It said savings from efforts to control costs and improve
efficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil and
natural gas prices.
    Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generation
activities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strong
throughout the period.

"Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, the
state owned oil company, has re-established posted prices for
some light products and heavy fuel oil, industry sources in New
York said.
    The return to posted prices is a sign that the market is
returning to a more stable and orderly condition after a year
of volatile price movements in which Venezuela ceased posting
prices and moved to negotiating prices with companies.
    ""We are in more stable market now and PDVSA has probably

oil which were also dropped in 1986.
    Posted prices were dropped in the first quarter of 1986  
when prices for crude oil and products tumbled in response to
OPEC's market share strategy and netback arrangements.
    PDVSA has set out posted prices for several groups of light
products including gasoline, naphtha, jet kerosene and
distillates effective April 15 as follows.
    Unleaded gasoline was posted at 19.74 dlrs a barrel (47 cts
a gallon) with leaded gasoline at 20.16 dlrs a barrel (48 cts a

    Light naphtha was posted at 17.85 dlrs a barrel (42.5 cts a

kerosene at 18.06 dlrs a barrel (43 cts a gallon).
    Distillates of 0.2 pct sulphur and 0.3 pct sulphur grades

0.5 pct sulphur 18.08 dlrs a barrel (43.05 cts a gallon).
    LPG postings, also effective from April 15, were made as 
follows, propane 175 dlrs a tonne (33.33 cts a gallon), butane
210 dlrs a tonne (46.26 cts a gallon) and isobutane at 240 dlrs

"A range of substantial policy
initiatives need to be implemented to shift resources from
consumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says the
Zimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economic
review.
    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe's
balance of payments improved significantly last year the
underlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved trade
surplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold and
continued import restraint.
    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pct
of exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.
    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first six
months of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturing
industry cut by a third.
    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in
1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrial
production almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreign
currency allocations almost trebled in real terms.
    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and the
Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As a
result the bank says the external purchasing power of foreign
currency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980
levels.

"Fine weather throughout Europe
allowed farmers to make good progress with sugar beet sowings
during the period April 16-21, but conditions in the Soviet
Union remained unfavourable, West German analyst F.O. Licht

    With daytime temperatures in parts of Europe exceeding 20

    Sowings this year will still be behind 1986 but Licht noted
that good results have often been produced from late-sown
crops.
    In the Soviet Union, however, most beet-growing regions
still had cool weather with night frosts. Only in the western
Ukraine was it warm enough to permit sowings, Licht said.

the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully
committed to halting a further decline in the dollar.
    ""Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations
remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination,
promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of
exchange rates,"" he told the American Enterprise Institute.
    ""We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be

accomplished over the past two years so that today we are
better positioned to promote growth and reduce external

foster stable exchange rates and those commitments were
renewed recently.

    ""They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet this
year's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on what
looks like a bigger harvest than we expected,"" he said.

"Shell Oil Co said first quarter net
income dropped 61 pct over the prior-year quarter on revenues
that slipped four pct.
    ""Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reduced
margins in our oil and chemical products businesses were the
major factor for the earings decline,"" John F. Bookout,
president, said in a statement.
    For the quarter, the company, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC>, earned 108 mln dlrs on sales of 4.50 billion
dlrs, compared with 276 mln dlrs on sales of 4.67 billion dlrs
a year ago.
    Bookout said the company is cautiously optimistic oil
markets will be less volatile in coming months than they were
in 1986.
    ""In coming months, oil products results should benefit from
seasonally higher gasoline volumes,"" he said.
    ""However, so long as U.S. product inventories remain high,
it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed margins
of recent periods,"" he added.
    Bookout said the company's chemical products earnings
should benefit from strong performances in chemical sales
volumes and continued high industry operating rates.
    Shell said its oil and gas exploration and product segment
earned 110 mln dlrs for the quarter vs 91 mln dlrs in 1986.
    It said earnings were hurt by lower selling prices for
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Domestic crude
oil prices averaged 14.24 dlrs a barrel, compared with 19.28
dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, Shell
said.
    Shell said earnings at its oil products segment plunged by
53 mln dlrs, to eight mln dlrs. It said lower refined product
selling prices were only partially offset by reduced raw
material costs.
    The company said earnings from chemical products also fell
sharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lower
margins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with its
pullout from the agricultural chemicals business in October
1986.
    Shell said capital and exploratory outlays totaled 500 mln
dlrs for the quarter, off from 645 mln dlrs.

"West German banks face disruption
from strike ballots and selective strikes after the breakdown
of talks on wages and working hours, the German Employees
Union, DAG, and the Commerce, Banking and Insurance Union, HBV,
said.
    But the chairman of the bank employers' federation, Horst
Burgard, told reporters in Frankfurt he hoped the two sides
would reach agreement after a pause for thought.
    DAG chief negotiator Gerhard Renner said the employers'
offer to resume talks was farcical as long as they refused to
remove the issue of flexible working hours from the talks.
    Both sides agreed there was now little point in top level
negotiations similar to those held in the engineering industry
which resolved a dispute on working hours.
    Renner and HBV chief negotiator Lorenz Schwegler said they
were prepared to compromise on the issue of flexible working
hours, but this subject should not be included in the wage
negotiations for the 380,000 bank employees.
    Burgard, also management board member of Deutsche Bank AG,
said the employers sought acceptance of more flexible hours on
an unchanged 40 hour week in the negotiations.
    The employers have unilaterally imposed a 3.6 pct pay rise
backdated to March 1, with the collapse of the talks. The HBV
is seeking a six pct rise and DAG a 6.5 pct increase.
    Schwegler said the unions would react to the collapse of
the talks with protest and warning strikes. Union officials
would resist overtime and attempts to introduce flexible hours.
    Next week the unions will set strike ballots aiming at
strikes in sensitive areas such as bank computer and bourse
data centres. The unions only account for some 25 pct of bank
employees. DAG will seek support from its members in the
Bundesbank who are not directly affected by the negotiations.

"The most likely reason for West German
producers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is
that they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtaining
European Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.
    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels
saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250
tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.
    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,
who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a
significant proportion of this for the same reason before they
are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.
    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level
of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,
with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to
leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of
the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.
    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes out
of around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87
series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high
tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and
subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids
for the export licences, traders said.

"The Ugandan government, in its four
year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and
food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from
dependence on coffee sales.
    The government also said in the plan, made available to
Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do
little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.
    The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took
power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in
investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.
    It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs
in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln
dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.
    Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the
end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt
servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export
earnings of 431 mln, the plan said.
    The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large
land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting
them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the
Produce Marketing Board.
    The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in
Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee
farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange
earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.
    On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument
that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.
    Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan
shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change
the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. The
shilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to the
dollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400.

"prime minister edward seaga
last night presented a budget of 6.9 billion jamaica dlrs, the
largest in the country's history, which projects increases in
capital spending and continued divestment of state companies.
    In a nationally televised speech to the parliament, the
prime minister, who is also minister of finance, said jamaica's
gdp grew by four pct, the highest level in 15 years, while
unemployment stood at 23.6 pct, down from last year's 26 pct.
Inflation, meanwhile, was 9.4 pct, as compared to 19.7 pct two
years ago.
    Government revenues were up by 419 mln jamaica dlrs, to 4.3
billion, enough to finance the entire recurrent expenditure of
3.7 billion dlrs, with a 666 mln dlr surplus.
    Seaga said that with financial accounts in order, the
government will proceed to reduce the country's debt service
ratio from the current level of 49 pct of gdp to 25 pct over
the next five years.
    During this period, he said, growth would be targetted at
three to four pct.
    The 6.9 billion dlr budget, which represents an increase of
18 pct over last year's 5.8 billion, will be financed by
borrowing of 8.868 billion dlrs and estmated revenue of 1.385
billion.
    Seaga said 1.835 billion of the budget will go to finance a
government capital investment program. The plan, which
represents a 10.3 pct increase over last year, projects greater
spending on health, education, housing and infrastructure. Some
818 mln dlrs in revenue to finance the budget will come from
the government's divestment program, which seaga said will be
stepped up in 1987.

"A cargo of U.S. corn for the Soviet
Union was rejected and forced to be unloaded at a Chicago
export elevator earlier this week after it failed to make
grade, with the British vessel Broompark now being reloaded, an
elevator spokesman said.
    The first attempt to load the ship failed when the
percentage of broken kernels proved to be higher than contract
specifications, he said.
    The Soviets traditionally refuse to take sub-grade grain at
a price discount, as is the practice with many other importing
nations, he added.
    The official estimated the reloading of the vessel with
about 700,000 tonnes of corn may be completed by Tuesday, April

"The Bank of Finland said it was
reducing restrictions on the use of money market rates as
reference rates for loans.
    The Bank would start quoting money market rates referred to
as HELIBOR (Helsinki Interbank Offered Rate). Banks may
henceforth use these as reference rates in their lending, it
said.
    From May 1 the banks would be allowed, without special
central bank approval, to use as a reference rate not only its
base rate but also other Bank of Finland rates or the official
money market rate used in market transactions.
    A derivative of these could also be used, the statement
said. But housing loans would be excepted and their lending
rate would, as formerly, be linked directly or indirectly to
the Bank of Finland's base rate.
    The new guidelines involve mainly two changes. Money market
rates in future would be used as reference rates for loans with
a maturity of over five years and the introduction of a new
reference rate would no longer require central bank approval.
    The decision was made as a continuation of the central
bank's process of liberalisation, it said.

"Rockwell International Corp &lt;ROK.N> has
signed an agreement leading to the takeover of Valeo &lt;VLOF.PA>
subsidiary &lt;SO.M.A. Europe Transmissions>, Valeo said in a
statement.
    The company said Rockwell had agreed to handle Soma sales
around the world and to help Valeo in restructuring its
loss-making subsidiary.
    It also said Rockwell, an American high-technology
engineering group with interests in aerospace and the car
industry, would take control of Soma at the beginning of 1988
if it obtained approval from the French government.
    Soma, a fully owned subsidiary of Valeo, makes axles and
gear boxes for heavy vehicles and machinery mostly used in the
construction business. A Valeo spokesman said &lt;S.E.S.M.>, a
subsidiary of Soma specialized in equipment for military
vehicles, had been excluded from the agreement with Rockwell.
     He said no details were available on the eventual amount
Rockwell would pay for Soma.
    Vehicle components maker Valeo was the object of a takeover
bid in 1986 by Italian group &lt;Compagnie Industriali Riunite>
(CIR), controlled by Olivetti chairman Carlo de Benedetti.
    The French government limited CIR's holding in Valeo to
less than 30 pct in June 1986, after classifying Valeo as a
defence contractor. Today CIR has effective control of Valeo
through its French holding company &lt;Compagnies Europeenes
Reunies>, Cerus, which has a 18.24 pct stake in Valeo.
    Since CIR won control of the French group in June, Valeo
has pursued a policy of concentrating its activities on the car
industry. The company spokesman said Valeo had sold off all its
construction interests in 1986 but declined to comment on the
amount of the sales.
    The spokesman said figures were not available on Soma's
losses in 1986 but said the company had registered a turnover
of 546 mln francs. Valeo recorded a consolidated net loss of
388 mln francs in 1986 on a turnover of 12.1 billion francs.

invitation for ministerial-level talks on bilateral cooperation
in silver marketing, a ministry spokesman said.
    Peruvian officials said they extended the invitation

Mexican central bank head Miguel Mancera Aguayo held private

    The spokesman said the talks were in line with mutual

    Press reports citing diplomatic sources at the meeting said
the two central bank heads discussed means of coordinating
actions in the silver market.
    Mexico is the world's leading silver produer. It produced
about 73.9 mln troy ounces in 1986, according to preliminary
government figures.
    Peru, the second biggest producer of the precious metal,
earlier this week froze new silver sales in an effort to

"The heads of the central banks of Mexico
and Peru have met in Mexico city to coordinate actions aimed at
consolidating the upward trend in the price of silver, the
official newspaper El Peruano said.
    It said that Peruvian central bank president Leonel
Figueroa met yesterday with the president of the bank of
Mexico, Miguel Mancera Aguayo.
   Peru, which froze new sales of refined silver and its
government-marketed silver ore on tuesday, is the world's
second biggest producer of the precious metal. Mexico is the
largest producer.
    Together, the two nations account for nearly 40 pct of the
world's silver output, the official paper El Peruano said.
    Peru adopted the move on tuesday in an bid to stablilise
the price of silver bullion, which has climbed in a month from
about 5.70 dlrs an ounce to over 9.00 dlrs an ounce today.
    After the meeting of the Peruvian and Mexican central bank
heads, it was understood that Mexico might diversify the use of
silver, El Peruano said.
    It said that Mexico and Peru did not want to speculate with
the price of silver. Instead, they aimed to see that the price
of the precious metal recuperated to adequate levels.
    El peruano did not specify what these levels were.
    El peruano quoted energy and mines minister Wilfredo Huayta
as saying that Peru did not want to participate in speculative
operations with silver.
    He said the government's aim was to avoid a ""brutal fall"" in
the price of silver.
    Figueroa's office confirmed the Peruvian central bank
president had travelled to mexico city. It was not certain if
he had returned to Lima by midday today.

"The U.S. M-1 money supply number to be
announced next Thursday is expected to show one of the largest
one-week increases in history, analysts said.
    The average forecast of economists polled by Reuters calls
for a 17.7 billion dlr M-1 jump for the week ended April 20.
Estimates of the increase range from five billion dlrs to 26.3
billion dlrs.
    ""The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds of
the increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,""
said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc.
    Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week is
implied by very strong deposit survey data and by an
unexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reserve
data released Thursday.
    Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement period
that ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basic
required reserves. Economists said this largely reflected the
parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market
sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.
Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for these
and other special factors.
    Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasury
also appear to be coming earlier than usual.
    They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed's
seasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.
    The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because the
link between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severed
by financial market innovation and deregulation.
    As such, there is likely to be little financial market
reaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to be
announced next week.

"The Soviet government said economic
results achieved in the first three months of the year were
unsatisfactory, the official news agency Tass said.
    Soviet industrial production from January to March grew by
2.5 per cent compared with the same period last year, but fell
short of its target by 0.8 percent, official statistics showed.
    ""The Council of Ministers (government) emphasised that the
results did not meet the Communist Party's exacting demands for
the radical reconstruction of the economy,"" Tass said. ""The first
quarter economic results were deemed unsatisfactory.""
    The government said poor economic results last January,
when industrial production was 0.1 lower than in January 1986,
had been overcome to a considerable extent in March, but the
negative effects had not been completely eliminated.
     It singled out failings in the engineering, chemical and
timber industries, as well as light industry.
    Growth in the machine-building sector, a priority in
Kremlin plans for economic renewal, also fell short of target
by 4.2 per cent, with below-level output in nearly all branches
at a cost of 723 million roubles (1.08 billion dollars) in
undelivered products.
    The sales volume of consumer goods fell 2.7 per cent short
of planned growth, with a resulting decline in income to the
state, the figures showed.
    Foreign trade turnover totalled 27.5 billion roubles (41.25
billion dollars), or 4.8 billion roubles (7.2 billion dollars)
less than in the same period last year.
    The power industry, however, performed well. Output of oil,
electricity, gas and coal were all above plan.

Sterling, Barclays Bank Plc chairman-elect John Quinton said.
    ""We should see a reasonable decline in interest rates in
the next few months, but not a great one and not a rapid one,""
Quinton told a press luncheon.
    He said that whereas the British economy is growing at
about three pct, he expects only ""minor"" growth for the western

move toward protectionism, there should be no need to worry
about a recession in the next two or three years.
    Quinton said much will depend on the resolution of trade

    He said Tokyo, in resisting the appreciation of the yen,
had been ""holding back the laws of economics."" But if the

"Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amount
of gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the
coming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor
fuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.
    ""They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in
the coming weeks,"" said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum Industry
Research Inc. ""If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,
gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could
potentially turn around in four to eight weeks,"" said
Goldstein.
    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocks
for the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last
year's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the
expected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the
surplus before the start of the summer driving season, which
begins Memorial Day weekend.
    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in
1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders said
that the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing
prices for the motor fuel.
    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected
refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in
continued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,
refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.
    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of
capacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 at
this time last year, API statistics show.
    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a
major oil company said he believed that most companies are
contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.
    He said some refiners appear to be selling less
aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the
expected rise in demand this summer.
    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed
limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new
restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the
supply situation this summer.
    However, a planner at another major oil company said that
although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for
gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output
soon.
    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce
the refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of
gasoline cheaper to produce.
    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the
summer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy Futures
Group Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the
second and third quarters of 1987.
    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising
1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued low
prices.

"Commission house livestock analysts
agreed with Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders in
calling today's USDA 13-state quarterly cattle on feed report
and cold storage report for pork bellies negative.
    June live cattle futures are called 0.20 to 0.50 cent lower
on Monday and back months of cattle are expected 0.50 to 1.00
cent lower. Pork bellies are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent or more
lower, the analysts said.
    Disappointment was voiced over the placement and total on
feed figures in the cattle report. Both the quarterly section
and monthly 7-state part showed the amount placed on feed and
on feed numbers at the high end of expectations.
    The other disappearance figure of only three pct above a
year ago in the 7-state section was also vieved as negative.
Most of the early guesses predicted a much larger number for
death loss following the two winter snow storms that struck the
west in late March, they said.
    However, weight groupings were friendly to the nearby
futures and should prompt some bull spreading on the decline,
they said.
    William Arndt from Dean Witter noted that the 900 to 1,100
lb steers and 700 to 900 lb heifers were at 94 pct of a year
ago and should lend some support to June futures. However, 700
to 900 lb steers at 119 pct will weigh on August, he said.
    ""The big reduction in cattle weighing over 900 lbs should
be friendly to the market for at least the next 30 to 60 days,""
AGE Clearing analyst Jerry Abbenhaus said.
    Movement of bellies into frozen storage was at the high end
of expectations and should weigh on futures tomorrow,
especially as futures prices ended weak today, they said.
    Other parts of the cold storage report were also viewed as
negative to livestock and meat futures.
    ""We have a lot of poultry in storage. Even though we have
smaller pork supplies, the decline is not enough to offset the
increases in poultry,"" Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt
said. Also, there is more beef in storage than last year and
this was achieved on smaller production.

"Energy and mines minister, Wilfredo

silver until the price of the precious metal reaches ""the true
value this raw material should have.""
    He spoke to reporters at the presidential palace after
meeting president Alan Garcia, whom he said recently spoke by
telephone with Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. Mexico
and Peru are the world's two largest silver producers.
    Huayta, asked what the true price level of silver should

    He said Minero Peru Comercial (Minpeco), the government's

    Last Tuesday, the government instructed Minpeco, which
handles all Peru's exports of refined silver and state-
produced ore, to immediately freeze all new silver sales until
the metal's price reached equilibrium in the world market.
   Peru plans to produce 63 mln ounces of silver this year, and
is the largest producer of the precious metal after Mexico.

"Brazil's trade surplus in March
totalled 136 mln dlrs, down from 1.13 billion dlrs in the same
month last year, the official Banco do Brasil announced.
    In a news conference, the director of the bank's Foreign
Trade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's 
weak performance to labour strikes.
    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53
billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.
    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to
1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March
1986.
    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in March
from 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were down
to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.
    He said that although the March results were considerably
lower than the same month last year, the government's target of
an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The
January-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below the
same period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.
    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said
the trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of the
last six months of the year.
    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes and
frozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared to
February, Fendt said this was not an indication that the United
States was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil in
the issue of informatics.
    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly trade
surplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billion
dlrs in the April-May-June period.

"High labour costs and slower corporate
investment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987,
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,
OECD, said.
    The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in
previous years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with
2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external
factors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat
said in its latest annual report on Sweden.
    It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in
Sweden than in other OECD countries.
    Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which
largely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.
Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, in
line with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose an
estimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985.
    This was significantly higher than average wage increases
of 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986.
    The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining
economic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiations
should be at least partly centralised to control the total
wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels.
    Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal
policy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from
almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other
OECD countries, the report said.
    Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in
1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECD
average of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employment
policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation.
    It also said that economic growth in 1986 relied
increasingly on private consumption because corporate
investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk.
    The total volume of industrial investments dropped by two
pct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulp
and paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985
when there was heavy investment in these industries.
    The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost
corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic
consumption for economic growth. It suggested there was room
for reform in the tax system.
    Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending,
especially in local government, to keep in line with its
tighter fiscal policy, the report said.

"The Peruvian government's freeze on silver
sales, which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal's
price, could draw retaliation by rich nations and big traders
seeking lower prices, President Alan Garcia said.
    Peru, the world's second biggest silver producer, stopped
selling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday.
Since then, the metal's price has risen to its highest level in
nearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounce
on world markets.
    Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Peru
could move international markets and did not have to accept
cheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenue
earners of the country.
    Peru exported its refined silver last year at an average
price of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago,
silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce on
world markets.
    ""One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells it
silently and in a submissive manner at the price world markets
want,"" he told reporters at the presidential palace.
    ""The other is that a nationalist government says, 'wait a
moment I can't sell silver at these prices,'"" he added.
    The peruvian energy and mines minister, Wilfredo Huayta,
said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales of
silver until the price of the metal reaches ""the true value this
raw material should have."" He did not specify this level.
    Garcia said rich nations and big traders, faced with Peru's
stance, could try to defend themselves.
    ""They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they can
make fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of our
mineral fall in the world market,"" Garcia said.
    ""Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru,"" he
said. ""Peru is in a position of action.""
    President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone with
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid, Huayta said. Mexico is
the world's biggest producer of silver.
    Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct of
the world's silver, the official newspaper El Peruano said.
    The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank president
Leonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico,
Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City yesterday to
coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend of
the price of the metal.
    Analysts in Zurich, a major silver trading centre, said
today the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investors
buying the metal to protect themselves against inflation, which
they fear could be rekindled by the dollar's weakness.
    On an historical basis, silver is still relatively cheap
compared to gold, which some investors believe could set the
stage for further rises, they said.

"The Ecuadorean economy, struck by an
earthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in
1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, the
government's national development council (Conade) said.
    A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that the
country's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by an
estimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conade
functions as the country's main planning institution.
    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from
105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mln
of crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.
    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people and
caused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzed
Ecuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's main
pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, to
the Pacific Ocean port of Balao.
    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line and
return output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuador
output was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.
    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,
572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.
    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986
exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs were
crude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.
    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billion
dlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this year
against 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projected
ceiling on payments is not legally binding.
    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at
934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986.

"The Bundesbank is trying to keep
monetary policy tight in order to counter inflationary
tendencies, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger was
quoted as saying.
    ""We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so that
inflationary pressures cannot develop,"" he told the Frankfurter
Neue Presse daily in an interview.
    ""Central bank money stock does not have to be reduced
because of this, but it must continue to grow modestly,"" he
said.
    Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment.
    On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to the
Handelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance in
West Germany caused by outside pressures could not determine
policy in the long term.
    The improvement in West German terms of trade, providing
room for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand in
excess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bank
money stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday.
    Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetary
measure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March,
above the 1987 three-six pct target range.
    Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target.
    Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phase
of falling prices was over in West Germany.
    Prices might still be lower on a comparison with their
level one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risen
to 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0,
expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said.
    In March the cost of living was steady against February but
0.2 pct below March 1986.
    Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during
1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability.
    Agreements so far in the current West German wage round are
neutral as far as inflation is concerned because of the
strength of the mark, Schlesinger said.
    Wage agreements in the public service and engineering
industry were relatively high in view of the stable cost of
living. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said.
    ""I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course of
this year we will in all probability have a stronger mark
against other currencies than last year,"" he said, adding
""Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to say
that the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices.""
    Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased the
scope for redistributing wealth this year, but this development
was unlikely to continue in 1988.
    ""For this reason I cannot comment on that part of the
engineering agreement which covers the coming years,"" he said.
    Some 2.3 mln workers for the public services received a 3.4
pct pay rise from January 1. An agreement for four mln
engineering workers raised pay by 3.7 pct from April 1, and
then raises pay by another two pct from April 1, 1988 and by
2.5 pct from April 1, 1989. The engineering agreement also cuts
the working week by 1-1/2 hours to 37 hours in two stages.

"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was
advised to work out a plan for his government to buy more than
one billion dlrs worth of foreign industrial products as part
of efforts to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United
States, officials said.
    Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe made the
recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone soon after returning

    Abe met President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Congressional

"Japan""s 1987 car export
restraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough, EC
external trade chief Willy de Clercq said.
    There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are
diverting cars to the EC after the dollar""s fall against the yen
made their U.S. Market unprofitable, he told reporters after
meeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.
    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion
in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to
currency movements over the past two years, it will move to
prevent it, he said.
    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollar
almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency
Unit, he said.
    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in car
exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its
rising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18
billion dlrs last year.
    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped
over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and a
seven per cent fall globally. ""We think there is some diversion
there,"" said de Clercq.
    Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only
10 pct.
    ""But even 10 pct is 100,000 cars, whereas we sell only
40,000 cars to Japan (per year) in total,"" he said.
    The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checks
and requirements for imported cars, which Brussels says is a
non-tariff barrier.
    The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars is
falling this year, making any rise in Japanese imports even
more serious for EC auto manufacturers.
    De Clercq, who has taken a hard line on world trade
problems at this weekend meeting in central Japan, said the EC
appreciated Japan""s plans to cut exports and lift domestic
growth instead.
    ""But even if all these measures are implemented, it will
take time. But there is not time,"" he said.
    ""There are burning issues on the table which cannot wait. It
were better that the fire were put out immediately and not to

"United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central
Bank Governor Abdel Malik al-Hamar said any changes in the UAE""s
exchange rate policy would be carried out in conjunction with

"Ministers from the major
trading nations have for the first time made a concerted
commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world
farm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.
    ""We think we can get some movement on this,"" she told
reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.,
Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.
    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the
cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen
their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war
between the United States and the EC.
    Japan""s protected agricultural markets have also attracted
criticism.
    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,
developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm
sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot
compete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.
    ""Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),
but many countries cannot,"" said Carney.
    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude
and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which
to discuss the issue.
    Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, and
at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,
begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.
    Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role
in the farm talks, and that the United States was willing to
see short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions were
not affected.
    Canada""s five point programme demands that farm product
prices must reflect open world market prices, that any support
for farmers incomes should not be linked to production
incentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new
farm import barriers, and that any decisions should be
implemented collectively.
    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the
industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the
Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.
    The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have
created some absurd situations.
    For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese government
buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price
to Japanese consumers.
    ""So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market
to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a
profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their
farmers,"" said Carney.
    The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the
already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.,
Japanese and EC banks.

"Bank profits in the Gulf oil state of
Qatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are
retrenching further in one of the region""s most overbanked
markets.
    Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for
several foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were
in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market
share.
    &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ>""s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla
Khalid al-Attiya, said: ""The economy is not improving as we
hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks.""
    Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of
60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about
280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank
operations.
    Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide
recession, aggravated this year by Qatar""s severe difficulty
marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a
heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability.
    As a result, the only U.S. Bank, &lt;Citibank NA>, is thought
to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing
locally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started
operations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment.
    Other foreign banks have retrenched, with &lt;Standard
Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.
&lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit
51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local
business, bankers said.
    One banker added: ""Weak profits are here to stay for the
time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment.""
    Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year
when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to
fixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was
having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices.
    The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude
prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been
running in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,
well down on the nation""s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources
said.
    Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar""s revenue has
led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to
private contractors after a marginal improvement in January.
    Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits
last year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve
requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has
almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income.
    Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the
government""s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage
its rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said.
    The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1
mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to
9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar.
    But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging
loans for the public and private sector to tide government
departments and local business over the lean economic spell,
Attiya said. ""Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar,"" he
said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.
    Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,
&lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to
27.5 mln riyals, while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,
registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.
    The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and
reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the
start-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985.
    Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win
commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,
increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to
reexamine their staffing levels and overheads.
    &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch
last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit
in 1985 of 12,000 riyals.
    Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the &lt;British
Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also
found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.
    BBME""s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in
1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985""s result
had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.
    ""Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local
banks are increasing their market share,"" Farquharson said.
    BBME""s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to
12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. ""We are expecting the
same level of operating profit in 1987,"" Farquharson said.
    Standard Chartered""s net profit last year recovered slightly
to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staff
numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads.
    Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar
means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes
are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could
provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates
may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore.

    His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. Treasury

"President Reagan warned the U.S.
Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what he
called dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that would
tie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other
countries.
    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffs
imposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as
Tokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.
    U.S. Officials gave the same message to former Japanese
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington last
week.
    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he
would tell Nakasone: ""We want to continue to work cooperatively
on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade
restrictions as soon as evidence permits.
    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade
retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his
staunch anti-protectionist policies.
    ""In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with
a particular problem, not begin a trade war,"" he said.
    But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to
try to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has cost
millions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories.
    A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman Richard
Gephardt is expected to come during Nakasone""s visit. It would
penalise nations with large trade surpluses and which are
alleged to use unfair trade practices.
    Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut his
ability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.
    ""With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice

"Four trade ministers ended a
weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments
are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not
regain it until they back their promises over trade and
currencies with action.
    ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to
action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,""
Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.
    ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain
policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two
days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United
States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.
    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140
yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to
underpin world trade.
    ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have
confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura.
    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought
over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free
trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired
confidence in the markets.
    ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you
belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if
you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de
Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: ""We
are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world
needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with
these problems we face.""
    She said that next month""s meeting of the Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders
of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to
show this will existed.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news
conference that the results of such high level meetings could
lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out
world trade imbalances perhaps years later.
    ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings
like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it
should be pursued,"" he said.
    ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds
what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said.
    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others""
positions and policies was just as important toward reducing
trade tensions, he said.
    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:
    Currency stability was now essential, but currency
movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with
Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC
deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus
of almost 90 billion, he said.
    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export
restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were
most dangerous, he said.
    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies
over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial
measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed
rules, he said.
    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be
strengthened, he said.
    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to
solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its
large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its
industries.
    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand
its domestic growth and rely less on exports.
    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and
reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in

"European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers resume discussions in Luxembourg tomorrow on tough
1987/88 farm price proposals from the bloc""s executive
Commission with only thin hopes of reaching a quick agreement.
    Their current chairman, Belgium""s Paul de Keersmaeker,
promised at the end of the group""s last meeting that if
agreement appeared in sight this week, he would keep his
colleagues at the negotiating table for long days and nights.
    But one diplomat told journalists: ""I don""t think you need to
worry about that. We are a long way from the crunch yet.""
    The commission has tabled a series of proposals which farm
experts say would together amount to the most swingeing attack
on overspending on the bloc""s Common Agricultural Policy, and
the biggest blow to farmers"" incomes, in years.
    As well as cuts in common farm prices of 2.5 pct in the key
cereals sector, quality standards for farm goods sold into EC
surplus stores would be raised and the period of the year when
such sales were allowed restricted.
    The experts say prices received by farmers would be cut by
over 10 pct for many crops if such measures were agreed.
    The effects, however, would be mitigated by Commission
proposals unveiled on April 14 for generous cash grants to
farmers worst hit by the struggle to curb EC food surpluses.
    When ministers met on March 30 and 31 in Brussels for
initial discussions on the farm price package, several, notably
France""s Francois Guillaume and West Germany""s Ignaz Kiechle,
said the proposals were unacceptably tough.
    Only the Dutch and British delegations gave general support
to the Commission line that such drastic measures were
necessary to curb surplus food production in the EC and to
reduce the massive cost of the CAP.
    But even then, the British are among several delegations
which oppose the Commission""s controversial plan to raise two
billion European Currency Units through a tax on imported and
EC-produced oilseeds and fats.
    In order to seek common ground, de Keersmaeker plans to
spend the whole of tomorrow in bilateral meetings with each of
his colleagues in turn.
    Diplomats said although the ministers will meet together on
Tuesday, de Keersmaeker is likely to conclude that further
talks at the level of officials are necessary and that the hard
bargaining will have to wait until May.

"Senior officials from the Group of
Seven (G-7) countries will meet next week to decide an agenda
for the body""s June summit scheduled to be held in Venice,
Japanese officials said.
    The meeting will provide senior government officials with
their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the
dollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longer
term, they said.
    Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-Finance
Minister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be held
in Italy, they said, but gave no other details.
    The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discuss
ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice.
    The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce
the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency
markets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked.
    Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can
do on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week saw
the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.
    The officials said they expected sentiment against the
dollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts to
fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.
    ""We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the
trade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet,"" one
said.
    Last week""s passage of the Japanese government budget by
parliament""s Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take
additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost
imports, the officials said.

"Plans for a new-style European
Community (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their
first full review from EC foreign ministers today, but are
unlikely to gather much support.
    Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism
of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget
payments by bringing member states"" contributions more into line
with national wealth.
    They said the EC""s current paymasters, Britain, France, and
West Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designed
to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s.
    Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five
billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in
February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system.
    Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging
cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological
research programs and regional and social spending projects.
    Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly
the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially
developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash
would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members.
    Delors"" plans, by linking a country""s contributions to its
Gross National Product (GNP), would over the next five years
add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion.
    Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage of
Value Added Tax (VAT) returns.
    Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct of
their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised
in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a
country""s total VAT receipts and its GNP.
    London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to
the scheme, arguing instead that money should be made available
from deep cutbacks in the EC""s heavily-subsidised farm sector.
    Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the
wearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highly
diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when
forced to do so.
    The issue is further complicated by a possible general
election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot
seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of
the way.

"Delegates from 46 countries are
gathering for the 20th meeting of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) amid concern over the bank""s role in aiding regional
development.
    The three-day meeting, the first to be held in Japan since
the bank""s inaugural meeting in Tokyo in 1966, will open
tomorrow with political controversy dogging its heels.
    Taiwan, one of the ADB""s founders, will boycott the meeting
for the second year in succession in protest against China""s
admission last year.
    Taiwan, which borrowed only 100 mln dlrs or 0.51 pct of the
ADB""s total lending of 19.4 billion dlrs over the past 20 years,
is staying away because its name was changed by the bank to
""Taipei, China.""
    But the boycott is likely to be overshadowed by the
presence of communist giants China and the Soviet Union.
    Moscow is attending an ADB meeting for the first time in
what is widely seen as a first step to eventual full
membership.
    China is expected to obtain its first loans from the bank
in 1987.
    A senior ADB official said Peking, now the bank""s third
largest shareholder after the United States and Japan, would
also take one of the 12 seats on the bank""s board of governors.
    The official, who declined to be identified, expected
sparks to fly when governors met in formal session on Tuesday.
    He said calls for expanded bank lending were expected from
poorer countries in the Asia-Pacific region, hit by plunging
commodity prices, tariff barriers in export markets, a growing
resources crunch and balance of payments crises.
    But the U.S. Delegation was likely to repeat warnings ADB
lending should stress quality over quantity, the official said.
    The debate over ADB lending is fuelled by the bank""s highly
successful money management.
    With liquid reserves of about four billion dlrs, profits
have been rising steadily and touched 287 mln dlrs last year.
    The key indicator of the ADB""s reduced role in regional
development is its net transfer of resources -- loan
disbursements less repayments made by borrowers -- which fell
sharply to 237 mln dlrs in 1986 from 421 mln in 1985.
    In 1986, the bank approved loans totalling two billion
dlrs, but only to 19 of its 29 developing members.
    ADB chief economist Kedar Nath Kohli told Reuters the bank""s
ordinary lending had declined each year since 1984.
    ""I""m afraid if you exclude India and China, it""s going to go
down even further in 1987,"" Kohli said.
    Kohli said developing countries in the region were entering
a period of painful adjustments.
    He said one country that seemed to be on the right track
was South Korea, which had bucked the regional trend of rising
indebtedness by cutting its foreign debt by about two billion
dlrs last year.
    One country that has complained about the ADB's lending
policies is Vietnam, which charged at last year's meeting that
the bank had cut off its aid on political grounds.
    The bank abruptly halted loans to Hanoi after the fall of
the Saigon government in 1975. Despite Moscow's presence,
however, the bank is not expected to change its Vietnam policy.
    The Philippines, the ABD's second-largest borrower in 1986
with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs, is happy with the bank's
role.
    Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters he expected the
figure would reach roughly the same level this year.

"Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
told a press conference the basic solution to currency
instability among major nations is economic policy
coordination.
    He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination
does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage. ""That
is democracy,"" he said. Upon that foundation, Miyazawa said,
there must be coordinated intervention. Major nations have
sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention, he added.
    ""Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will
continue to operate,"" Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S.
President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and
Washington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency
stability when they meet later this week.
    Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major
currencies, not only the yen, Miyazawa declined to make any
comments.
    He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken
coordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar,

"CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it plans to offer
3.50 dlrs a share cum-bonus for all the issued capital of
building products group Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>.
    The offer values Monier's current issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 547 mln dlrs and compares with the latest share
market price of 2.80 dlrs, equal to last Friday's close.
    Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-two
bonus issue before June 30.
    CSR will shortly announce further details of the offer
including a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement.
    CSR said it currently holds 323,000 Monier shares or only
0.21 pct of the company's issued capital.
    Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,
has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer for
its stake initially, CSR said.
    Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options,
the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer at
the same price within six months of the closing date of the
bid, the company said.
    The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monier
holding to 50.1 pct in the same period.
    The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs a
share, CSR said.
    Both option deals are subject to the approval of Monier
shareholders except CSR and Redland.
    As previously reported, Redland and Monier had been
discussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talks
broke off two weeks ago.
    CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means of
establishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials in
which they both have interests. At the end of the offer, they
will discuss how these interests may be developed.
    Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to consider
at a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable it
to become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises the
second option, CSR said.
    It said the offer is generous because it will give Monier
shareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-tax
earnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium over
Friday's market price and a 125 pct premium over last reported
net tangible asset backing per share of 1.57 dlrs.
    The offer is beneficial for both CSR and Monier
shareholders, CSR's chief executive officer Bryan Kelman said.
    ""The acquisition will broaden CSR interests in building
materials by the addition of complementary domestic and
overseas businesses in concrete and clay tiles, metal roofing
materials and concrete blocks and piping,"" Kelman said in the
statement.
    ""Importantly, the acquisition will provide CSR with new
growth opportunities in building materials both in Australia
and overseas,"" he added.
    Monier, which earned a net 32.49 mln dlrs in 1985/86, has
operations in a number of countries, including the U.S., Japan,
Britain and New Zealand, as well as Australia.

    ""No specific plans exist for applying for membership,"" Yurij

told Reuters. ""It's too early to draw up any plans.""
    The USSR is attending the 20th meeting as an observer.

    ""This is one of the fastest growing regions in the world,""
the State Bank official said. ""It is in our interest to have
good contacts.""
    But those strengthened contacts will not be made at the
expense of the Soviet Union's other relationships, he said.
    Delegates here said the USSR move was connected to recent
efforts to develop closer ties with Asia. The policy was
announced last year by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a
speech at Vladivostok.
    Moscow's decision to attend the meetings follows its
application last year for membership of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
    Delegates said the USSR faces lacklustre growth and is
searching for ways to boost its economy.
    Although the ADB said political ideology is not a critiera
for membership, several delegates said politics would play a
large role in any decision to allow Moscow to join.
    Moscow's application would have to be approved by
two-thirds of the board of governors representing
three-quarters of the total voting power of member countries.
    The basic votes of the 47 members are all equal and total
one-fifth of all votes. The remainder are proportional to the
number of shares held by each member.
    Japan is the largest shareholder, at 15.1 pct, followed by
the U.S. With 14.9 pct and China with 7.2 pct.
    The U.S. Has more than 12 pct of the total votes,
insufficient to block a Moscow membership bid.

regarding the possibility of Soviet membership and said they
noted the Soviets had not yet made any move to join.

"President Reagan is expected to tell
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be
able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that
under such a scenario the President would announce just before
the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped
to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of
the month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had
stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in
Japan for U.S. Chip producers.
    The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools
and personal computers on April 17.
    Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he
arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the
immediate lifting of the tariffs.
    But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against
Japanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as
the best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal
formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would
allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory.

Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters.
    Ongpin said the loan, carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year,
matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the
World Bank in March.
    Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the
Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting
here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed.
    Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to
a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and
80 billion yen.
    The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87
fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of the
Philippines' change of government last year.
    ""The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we
are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49
billion yen,"" he said. ""But they are likely to bring it up to
that level for the 15th package.""
    Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the
14th yen package.
    ""We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of
untied commodity loans,"" he said.
    Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft
loans to finance a land reform program, for which Japan is
expected to supply most of the financing, had been put off
until next month because of delays in preparatory work.
    Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform
program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here.
    Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's
support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed
leader Ferdinand Marcos.
    ""But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the
field of lending to the private sector,"" he said.
    The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower
after Pakistan in 1986, with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs.
    Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in
1987 to reach the same level.

want. But we have to come up with the projects,"" he said.

June to stimulate economic growth, Finance Minister Daim

    The last cut, of 0.5 pct, was effected by banks and finance

"India, which received its first
loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986, expects to
increase borrowing this year, an Indian official said.
    The official, a member of the Indian delegation at the
ADB's annual meeting here, told Reuters the bank is likely to
approve three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in
1987, up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986.
    The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan for
the modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had been
completed and only need approval by the bank's board.
    The official said an ADB team is now in India for a survey
of the second project involving imports of railway locomotives.
He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to the
Industrial Development Bank of India.
    The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit to
state-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India.
    The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lending
to India. ""They (the bank) do not want their traditional
borrowers from smaller countries in the region to get
overwhelmed by (India and China),"" he said. China is expected to
receive its first ADB loan this year.
    ""We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window in
borrowing,"" the official said. ""Our projects are being vetted
quickly. We have no complaints.""
    He said the ADB in any case would not be able to match
Indian borrowing needs.
    ""In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billion
dlrs from the World Bank alone,"" he said.
    ""That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowers
in 1986.""

multilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total four
billion dlrs in 1986/87.

an economic package in response to demands from organised
labour in Venezuela for a general wage increase and controls on
inflation, the state news agency Venpres reported.

"Good soaking rain is boosting the sugar
cane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following a
prolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, an
Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.
    The rains began late last week, developed into heavy
downpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he said
from Brisbane.
    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow about
half the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland cane
areas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.
    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, just
to the north of the Mackay region on the central Queensland
coastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshened
the crop there.
    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,
the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the
25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturn
of 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.
    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely a
couple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin crops
were going to suffer badly, he said.
    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be available
early next month, the spokesman said.
    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start later
this year, in late June or early July against mid-June last
year, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.
    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.
    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, with
some mill areas expecting record crops, he said.
    Industry records show variations in the crop are not always
mirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweeter
cane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws.

"The Bundesbank urged the West German
government not to relax efforts to rein in spending when taxes
are cut in a 1990 fiscal reform package, saying that higher
expenditure could lead to a dangerous rise in interest rates.
    The Bundesbank's 1986 annual report said the government's
choice of measures to compensate for any cut in tax income was
a key political task. ""There will also be consequences for the
state's attitude on spending,"" it said.
    It added that, while tax cuts should have a stimulatory
effect on the economy, the government should not expect any
significant increase in tax income in the short-term.
    The reform will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, of
which 19 billion marks will be financed through as yet
unspecified measures.
    The Bundesbank noted that reducing tax preferences and
financial grants as well as raising some indirect taxes were
being considered.
    ""As experience shows that a tax cut is not self-financing
... The question remains of how the rest of the tax cuts will
be financed,"" the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank noted that in 1986, spending had increased
by more than the three pct annual average rise for 1982 to
1986. If this three pct limit were exceeded over a long period,
there would be a danger that increased new borrowing would be
necessary to finance deficits.
    It added that interest rates in West Germany were now low,
partly because of a high influx of foreign funds. But the
situation would become more difficult if the government's
credit requirements increased massively. ""The anticipated
stimulatory effects on the economy from the tax cuts could be
thrown into jeopardy by higher interest rates,"" it said.

"Germany's current account and trade

    The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround in
external factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was not
expected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal.
    West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billion
marks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current account
surplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion.
    Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor already
noted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly,
would lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said.
    In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986
while exports only increased by 0.8 pct.
    Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional
6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but was
down from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.
    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4

U.S. And Japan have long had friendly ties that neither side

"Central bank money stock was growing
at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from
9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that
the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above
target, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.
    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct
growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for
central bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,
outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.
    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was
limited by a series of external factors.
    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign
payments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.
    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot
in 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with
interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward
pressure on the mark, it said.
    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic
if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were
invested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or
foreign securities, the Bundesbank said.
    But if companies and private households continue to hold
their funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency
inflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.
    ""The more the conflict between external constraints and
domestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at
the time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be
to do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply
control,"" the Bundesbank said.
    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again
at the start of 1987.
    There would be virtually no easing of other production
costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.
    ""Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in
this year,"" the Bundesbank said.
    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying
price rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.
    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term
borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for
the same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the
risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing
themselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

"A top United Arab Emirates (UAE)
banker said a new law would be introduced soon obliging courts
to recognise interest rates contracted between bank and
borrower.
    Sheikh Suroor bin Sultan al-Dhahiri, Chairman of Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank, told reporters after the shareholders' meeting
last night the decree would make interest in debt cases payable
at the contracted rate up to the day a case is filed in court.
    Subsequently, interest would be charged at a maximum nine
pct for personal and 12 pct for corporate loans, he said.
    The law, if passed, would mark a breakthrough in solving
what UAE bankers say is one of their biggest problems,
collecting bad debts in court.
    Under current UAE law in all emirates, except Dubai, courts
recognise only simple interest at a maximum nine and 12 pct
even if a loan was contracted at higher compounded rates.
    The Central Bank said last year that roughly a quarter of
total loans in the UAE banking system were non-performing.
Sheikh Suroor also said a judicial committee set up to consider
debt cases would begin functioning within a month.

"Attempts to hold currency rates
rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System
intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing
funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still
considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.
    ""The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker
tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory
intervention when rates hit band limits,"" it said in its 1986
annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion
could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its
central bank being involved in the activity.
    ""For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much
room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a
currency is in a phase of weakness,"" the Bundesbank said.
    ""In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive
to hold when interest differentials are increased.""
    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the
extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that
has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency
system on March 13, 1979.
    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central
banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another
participating unit.
    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement
between central banks when speculative pressure moves a
currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be
near any allowed EMS limits.
    At the start of this year, central banks were very actively
selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the
French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.
    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was
ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to
its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.
    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks
bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986
realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.
    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July
8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling
63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal
and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.
    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total
eventually filtered into the West German monetary system.
    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought
16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the
Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.
    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983
realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.
Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the
period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the
dollar surged.
    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from
July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.

"Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided to
keep Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in office for a
further eight years, the news magazine Der Spiegel said.
    Government officials were not immediately available to
comment on the report, which said that because Poehl is a
member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Kohl had not taken
the decision lightly.
    Poehl has been Bundesbank chief since January 1, 1980,
while Kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held power
since 1982.
    Der Spiegel said Kohl would have preferred to offer the
post to a member of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
    But the magazine noted Poehl enjoyed a good international
reputation. Officials have often said Poehl and CDU Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg hold each other in high regard.
    Poehl's current term expires at the end of this year.
Officials have said no date has been set for an announcement on
whether his tenure will be extended.
    Poehl was made an economic adviser to SPD Chancellor Willy
Brandt in 1971. A year later he was appointed State Secretary
at the Finance Ministry when former SPD Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt was Finance Minister.
    There has recently been press speculation that the
Bundesbank presidency may be offered to Poehl's deputy, Helmut
Schlesinger, a conservative monetarist.
    According to these reports, Schlesinger would be replaced
two years later by CDU member Hans Tietmeyer, the current
Finance Ministry State Secretary.
    Also under discussion as president was Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank board and a CDU member who
is known to be close to Kohl.

"The resignation of Finance Minister
Dilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazil
will now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards an
accord with creditors, bankers and political analysts said.
    With Funaro in charge, Brazil's relations with creditors
sank to a low ebb, they said.
    Bankers told anti-Funaro jokes from Sao Paulo to New York
and economic analysts said the personal animosity between the
minister and U.S. Bankers was a real obstacle to reaching
agreement on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr debt.
    Commenting on Funaro, a foreign banker here recently told
Reuters, ""They (banks) see his removal pretty much as a
precondition for getting serious negotiations under way.""
    Funaro angered the banks in February by suspending interest
payment on Brazil's 68 billion dlr bank debt.
    There was also a question of personal style. Bankers
disliked Funaro's aloof demeanor and in private heatedly
accused him of arrogance and inflexibility.
    However, Funaro did not fall because he upset foreign
bankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze last
year was a massive flop, economically and politically.
    However, it is in the domain of the debt and Brazil's
relation with creditors that his departure will have the most
closely-watched international repercussion, bankers said.
    It became part of Funaro's trademark that he would have no
truck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus
effectively blocking a debt agreement.
    He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF, the
Fund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession.
    Funaro and others who supported this position had memories
of the IMF austerity program in Brazil in the early 1980s, a
period when hungry crowds stormed supermarkets.
    The foreign banker in Sao Paulo said, ""I think Brazil could
have an agreement with the IMF which would allow (it)
acceptable growth.""
    Argentina, working with the IMF, won excellent terms for a
major portion of its 50 billion dlr debt earlier this month.
    Given the IMF role in the Argentine accord, a U.S. Diplomat
here said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funaro
because it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit.
    Mexico has also taken the IMF path and, earlier than
Argentina, clinched a favourable pioneering agreement with
creditors on its 100 billion dlr debt.
    Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest Latin
American debtors not to have a debt agreement.
    Some Brazilian opinion, particularly in the business
community, is favourable to an IMF accord.
    A leading newspaper, Jornal do Brazil, carried a report
from Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMF
brought recession and the best moment for an accord was now. As
it happens, a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia.
    The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it is
considering any major change in debt policy and political
analysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue.
    The government of President Jose Sarney has gained a
reputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believe
the government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to the
conclusion there really is no option.
    But such a policy shift looks more and more likely before
too long in the eyes of many analysts.
    One major political obstacle, Funaro, is no longer in the
picture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing.
    The sharp drop in the trade surplus, which triggered
Brazil's present debt crisis, shows no sign of being reversed.
In the first quarter of 1987 Brazil chalked up a surplus of
only 526 mln dlrs, just a fraction of the 2.47 billion dlr
surplus it had in the same period last year.
    Brazilian officials concede that time is not on their side
in the debt crisis.
    ""Brazil has an interest in resolving this problem as rapidly
as possible,"" Central Bank President Francisco Gros said on
Friday.

"Oil prices have stabilized in world
markets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of
the year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil
prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed
price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand
have been in equilibrium since March.
    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half
of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC
producers have not been able to produce more oil at current
prices, he said.
    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,
whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels at its next meeting in June.
    He said in his speech that world oil production over the
last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two
mln barrels a day less than world oil demand.
    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly
the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but
some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in
Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.
    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the
upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier
speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.
    ""If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume
its former role in world oil markets,"" he said.
    ""But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30
dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,""
Subroto said.

"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said he
hopes his visit to Washington later this week will help resolve
Japan's severe trade problems with the United States.
    Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the United
States on Wednesday, only weeks after President Reagan imposed
punitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic
goods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact.
    Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the
U.S. Congress for further action to help improve trade
imbalances.
    Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a
record 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.
    Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe,
who has just returned from Washington, told him protectionist
sentiment in the United States is severe.
    ""We are well aware of a movement in the United States to
enact legislation,"" Nakasone said.
    He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to
go to the United States but it is now more important than ever
that he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views
of the United States.
    ""My visit to the United States at this time will be the most
important visit of all,"" Nakasone said.
    While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid and
frank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl
leaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability,
economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Soviet
disarmament and arms control.
    On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said he
would present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are
increasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third
countries.
    ""We have full confidence we can present clear evidence,"" he
said. ""(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be lifted
at the earliest possible time.""
    On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has already
taken action. The volume of exports to the United States has
been cut, while U.S. Imports have increased.
    But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations
have recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,
indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.
    Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the
trade imbalance but the United States will have to become more
competitive and improve its huge budget deficit.
    He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit
of the seven major industrial nations in June.
    ""We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace,
disarmament and the world economies as a whole through
solidarity,"" Nakasone said.

"Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian
Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese
money for the organisation.
    ""We are ... Striving to enhance the flow of capital from
Japan to the developing countries,"" he said.
    ""The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for
us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance.""
    He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special
Japanese fund at the ADB, like the one at the World Bank.
    The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing
countries.
    Developing countries and the United States have criticised
Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor
countries.
    Later this week, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is
expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as
much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next
three years, Japanese officials said. The exta ADB funding
would be part of that amount.
    ""Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviating
the burden on (developing countries),"" said Miyazawa, who is
also chairman of the ADB board of governors.
    ""The developing countries today find themselves in a very
difficult situation,"" he said. ""With a few notable exceptions,
those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity
exports face a rough road ahead.""
    While the developing countries can help themselves by
striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to
attract foreign investment, the ADB also has a role to play, he
said.
    Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its
economic advice program to developing nations and must work
vigorously to identify development projects for loans.
    He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to
development projects, but provided more overall help to the
borrower.
    ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.
    ""The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor,""
Fujioka said. ""The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a
range of services required to attend to varied needs of its
developing members.""
    Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its
Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would not
have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment.
    Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank
raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need
to do so, he said.

"The United States and Japan are waging a
behind the scenes battle at this week's Asian Development Bank
meeting over Tokyo's attempts to win a greater say in the
organization, U.S. And Japanese delegates said.
    Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because it
would mean the end of the long-standing parity between the two
nations in the Bank, U.S. Officials said.
    Right now, the two countries' voting shares are about
equal, Japan having 12.53 pct and the United States 12.36 pct.
The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the U.S.
Subscription to the Bank.
    ""It's quite a delicate matter,"" Japanese Finance Ministry
deputy director general Fumiya Iwasaki told Reuters. ""I don't
see the discussion ending soon.""
    The issue is further complicated because other member
nations would have to give up some of their power in the Bank
if Japan were to increase its influence, he said.
    Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting in
Manila, arguing that the 3.7 billion dlrs it has contributed to
the Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in the
overall organization. The United States has given 1.2 billion
dlrs to the Asian Development Fund.

Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters.
    Ongpin said the loan, carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year,
matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the
World Bank in March.
    Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the
Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting
here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed.
    Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to
a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and
80 billion yen.
    The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87
fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of the
Philippines' change of government last year.
    ""The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we
are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49

untied commodity loans,"" he said.
    Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft
loans to finance a land reform program, for which Japan is
expected to supply most of the financing, had been put off
until next month because of delays in preparatory work.
    Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform
program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of

"Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided to
keep Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in office for a
further eight years, the news magazine Der Spiegel said.
    Government officials were not immediately available to
comment on the report, which said that because Poehl is a
member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Kohl had not taken
the decision lightly.
    Poehl has been Bundesbank chief since January 1, 1980,
while Kohl's conservative/liberal coalition has held power
since 1982.
    Der Spiegel said Kohl would have preferred to offer the
post to a member of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
    But the magazine noted Poehl enjoyed a good international
reputation. Officials have often said Poehl and CDU Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg hold each other in high regard.
    Poehl's current term expires at the end of this year.
Officials have said no date has been set for an announcement on
whether his tenure will be extended.
    Poehl was made an economic adviser to SPD Chancellor Willy
Brandt in 1971. A year later he was appointed State Secretary
at the Finance Ministry when former SPD Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt was Finance Minister.
    There has recently been press speculation that the
Bundesbank presidency may be offered to Poehl's deputy, Helmut
Schlesinger, a conservative monetarist.
    According to these reports, Schlesinger would be replaced
two years later by CDU member Hans Tietmeyer, the current
Finance Ministry State Secretary.
    Also under discussion as president was Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank board and a CDU member who
is known to be close to Kohl.

clarification from the U.S. About its decision to freeze rice
export prices from January to early April, Commerce Minister
Montri Pongpanich said.
    Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed to
set its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising world
prices during the period.
    He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening world
rice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lower
than those quoted by Thai traders.
    Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by the
U.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up to
April 8.
    Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S.
Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exporters
enabling them to compete with Thai exporters.
    Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell
19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarter
this year.
    The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnes
in January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.
    It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctance
of Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world prices
did not rise in line with firming domestic prices.
    The board said, however, that Thailand may export more rice
later this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East and
Asia, due to lower production in many drought affected African
countries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burma
and Pakistan.
    It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers rose
to 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a year
earlier.

exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its

Japanese officials said.

    The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce
the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency
markets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked.
    Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can
do on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week saw
the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.

dollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts to
fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.
    ""We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the
trade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet,"" one

"Oil prices have stabilized in world
markets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of
the year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil
prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed
price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand
have been in equilibrium since March.
    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half
of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC
producers have not been able to produce more oil at current
prices, he said.
    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,
whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels at its next meeting in June.
    He said in his speech that world oil production over the
last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two
mln barrels a day less than world oil demand.
    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly
the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but
some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in
Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.
    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the
upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier
speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.
    ""If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume
its former role in world oil markets,"" he said.
    ""But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30
dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,""
Subroto said.

"Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPEC
oil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel
unless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic
Survey (MEES) said.
    The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative
Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would
not change ""unless and until there is a strong revival in the
growth of demand for oil.""
    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price
hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.
    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the
long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in
general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy
sources.
    ""Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its
OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to
maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level,"" MEES
said.
    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks
of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,
causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.
    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around
16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for
March and Reuter estimates for March.
    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this
month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with
an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month
to two mln bpd, not including ""war relief"" supplies from Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.
    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln
bpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added.

"The cut in the lending rates and other
changes made in the interest rates will hit the profitability
of many commercial banks in India, Indian Banks' Association
chairman M. N. Goiporia told a bankers' conference.
    The changes were announced by the Reserve Bank of India on
March 31 and became effective on April 1.
    ""Some of the latest credit policy measures such as reduced
lending rates, raising the statutory liquidity ratio and
restructuring of deposit rates will pose a potential threat to
commercial banks' continuing higher profitability levels,"" he
said.
    Goiporia said most foreign and Indian commercial banks
including those owned by the government have been making
profits over the years, mainly due to better fund management
and the enlargement of the banks' capital base. He did not
elaborate.
    The Reserve Bank's new credit policy for commercial banks
cut the maximum lending rate by one pct to 16.5 pct, raised
rates on deposits of two years by a half pct to nine pct and by
one pct to 10 pct on deposits of more than two years. To cut
excess liquidity in the industry, the Reserve Bank raised the
banks' liquidity ratio by a half pct to 37.5 pct, immobilising
nearly five billion rupees of deposits, bankers said.

"French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said the Group of Seven major industrial nations, G-7, can
achieve stable currency values by adhering to accords reached
this year in Paris and Washington.
    Balladur, asked at a news conference if coordinated market
intervention by central banks was sufficient to halt the
dollar's recent slide, said ""each country has to fulfill
commitments"" outlined in the G-7 accords.
    Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of the
U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada
reaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall.
    Balladur said the current nervousness in foreign exchange
markets can be partly attributed to ""some operators in the
market only watching short term economic indicators. You have
to keep a cool head,"" he said, declining to elaborate further.
    In an earlier speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce,
the minister said European countries have to seek ""a better

    On the European Monetary System, he said, ""The persistent
vulnerability of the foreign currency mechanism, particularly
to the movements of the dollar, can be explained by the absence
of a common policy for currencies of other countries.""
    Balladur said, ""I am profoundly convinced that the European
countries have to define together this position with respect to

    He said Italy eventually would have to abandon its higher
margin of fluctuation within the European Montetary System. ""I
hope that the spectacular improvement of the economic situation
and of the balance of payments will permit (Italy) to do it
soon.""

side of its agreed midpoints with other EMS currencies of six

"Norway's stock exchange has touched record
levels, propelled by higher oil prices and foreign buying
interest. But analysts say the bullish trend probably will not
last. Tight restrictions on foreign ownership of shares have
held back development on the market, they say. While some of
these rules could soon be eased, Norway's unresolved economic
woes mean the prices boom is likely to be short-lived.
    Last Thursday, the all-share index reached 325.48 points to
beat the previous record of 325.31 set in mid-November, 1985.
    Brokers say the new record, spurred by firmer oil prices
above 18 dlrs a barrel which are crucial to Norway's economy,
has for now set the Oslo bourse apart from the current
fluctuations on other world stock markets.
    ""It's an underdeveloped market...Virgin territory ,"" Jenny
Tora, a Scandinavian securities analyst with London-based
stockbrokers James Capel, told Reuters.
    But the attraction for foreign investors of the stock
market, where price/earnings ratios average around a relatively
low 11, is tempered by restrictions and some nervousness about
the future of Norway's economy, analysts say.
    Foreign ownerhsip is limited in all sectors and varies
between 10 and 40 pct of the shares of any company - and the
class of shares rarely carry voting rights.
    ""It's often hard to get stocks as the quotas are full,"" Tora
said. ""There can be problems of liquidity in the market. You can
get into the market, but perhaps not get out.""
    Analysts said this meant that foreign interest had been
restricted mostly to professional trading rather than client
buying, and that the market missed some speculative impetus.
    There are also no stock options, and bonds cannot be held
by foreigners in Norwegian securities trading.
    Thor Bang, chief economist at Den Norske Creditbank A/S,
Norway's biggest bank, said he thought the stocks boom had
little foundation in Norway's economic situation.
    ""One of the factors (in the rise) is a belief in...Political
stability,"" he told Oslo's business daily, Dagens Naeringsliv.
    The minority Labour government has looked increasingly
stable since it came to power in May, 1986, with the former
right-centrist coalition in disarray.
    But stock market analysts say continued economic problems
could soon jeopardise the bourse's bull trend, in spite of the
appreciation of the crown against the dollar.
    Although firming oil prices mean better news for Norway,
Western Europe's biggest oil producer after Britain, analysts
point to high interest rates, uncertainty over the future price
of oil and a weighty current account balance of payments
deficit as threats to the bourse.
    Interest rates stand at around 14 pct, while annual
inflation is 10 pct. The current account balance of payments
deficit stood at 32.8 billion crowns last year, against a
surplus of 26.8 billion crowns in 1985.
    ""I'd be very cautious about present stock levels,"" Chris
Honnor of London-based brokers Grieveson Grant said.
    The record-breaking performance last Thursday meant that
the all-share index had increased by 16 pct from the start of
1987.
    On Friday the index leapt another 7.78 points to 333.26.
But analysts noted this was largely due to much better than
expected profits in the first quarter from Norsk Hydro,
Norway's largest diversified corporation.
    Foreign investors, spurred by the appreciating crown and
the rise in oil prices, have been more prominent in the market
this year, although they still trade selectively mainly in
Norsk Hydro, Norsk Data and a few other top-traded industrials.
    Earlier this month the government proposed allowing the
share of foreign ownerhsip permitted in financial institutions
to rise in a bid to boost competition. Depending on the
circumstances, the share foreign owners can have will rise from
10 pct to between 15 and 25 pct.
    Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest fully private oil company,
has also said it will seek government permission to boost
permitted foreign share ownerhsip to 40 pct from the present 20
pct. Saga shares have registered some of the strongest gains on
the bourse because of the move, adding more than 60 pct to
their value so far this year.

"Treasury Secretary James Baker has
cancelled a trip to Australia because of pressing business at
home, including the visit this week by Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, a Treasury spokesman said.
    The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said: ""I
would not draw any conclusion from the cancellation...I would
just say it's the press of business.""
    But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was ""part
of the press of business.""
    The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to the
current turmoil in the financial markets.
   
    Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currency
markets. Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with him
measures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansion
or lower interest rates, the visit is likely to be considered
by currency markets as an outright failure.
    In addition, it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasone
and Reagan will agree on the removal of U.S. trade sanctions
imposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods.
    But the participation in the talks by Baker, the
administration's top policy maker on international economic
affairs, suggests that hard bargaining between the two sides
may be in prospect.
   
    Asked if the trip by Baker, who was to have left April 30
and returned May 6, had been dropped in the last couple of
days, the Treasury spokesman replied: ""I would think so.""
    He described the trip as ""purely ceremonial.""
    Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from an
unsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks.
    Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency 
markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen, which
economists fear could send world interest rates soaring and
even lead to global recession.
    Baker has been the driving force behind the
administration's efforts to coordinate international economic
policies and reduce global trade imbalances.

"The Reagan Administration is

serious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory.
    Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of the
imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese
goods for the first time since World War Two.
    In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cotton
goods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have ended
with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs.
    Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a
protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives.
    A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by Representative
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annual
reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations
which have large trade gaps with the United States.
    The United States last year had a record trade deficit of
169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third.
    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently
he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between
the two leaders.
    Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back and
forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's
visit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event will
be in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.
    Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body
led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa.
    Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boost
domestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products including
supercomputers and give more help to developing countries,
government officials said.
    The government has been making last ditch efforts in time
for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,
officials said.
    The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese
overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr
international airport project in western Japan.
    Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise
accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax
plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House
of a government draft budget for 1987/88.
    The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,
virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room for
future tax reform plans, political analysts said.
    Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoral
triumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the sales
tax.
    His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election
and nationwide local elections in the past two months.
    Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at Waseda
University, told Reuters: ""I doubt that whatever Nakasone does
in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help
restore his weakened power-base at home.""
    Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after the
Venice summit of industrialized nations in June.

"Attempts to hold currency rates
rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System
intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing
funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still
considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.
    ""The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker
tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory
intervention when rates hit band limits,"" it said in its 1986
annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion
could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its
central bank being involved in the activity.

    ""For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much
room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a
currency is in a phase of weakness,"" the Bundesbank said.
    ""In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive
to hold when interest differentials are increased.""
    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the
extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that
has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency
system on March 13, 1979.

    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central
banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another
participating unit.
    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement
between central banks when speculative pressure moves a
currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be
near any allowed EMS limits.
    At the start of this year, central banks were very actively
selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the
French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.

    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was
ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to
its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.
    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks
bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986
realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.
    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July
8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling
63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal
and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.

    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total
eventually filtered into the West German monetary system.
    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought
16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the
Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.
    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983
realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.
Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the
period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the
dollar surged.
    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from
July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.

"Four trade ministers ended a
weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments
are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not
regain it until they back their promises over trade and
currencies with action.
    ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to
action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,""
Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.
    ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain
policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two
days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United
States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.
    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140
yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to
underpin world trade.
    ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have
confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura.
    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought
over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free
trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired
confidence in the markets.
    ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you
belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if
you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de
Clercq.
    Pat Carney of Canada said ""We are meeting in a time of great
trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the
political will to deal with these problems we face.""
    She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders
of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to
show this will existed.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news
conference that the results of such high level meetings could
lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out
world trade imbalances perhaps years later.
    ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings
like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it
should be pursued,"" he said.
    ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds
what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said.
    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each
others' positions and policies was just as important toward
reducing trade tensions, he said.
    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:
    Currency stability was now essential, but currency
movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with
Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC
deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus
of almost 90 billion, he said.
    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export
restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were
most dangerous, he said.
    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies
over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial
measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed
rules, he said.
    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be
strengthened, he said.
    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to
solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its
large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its
industries.
    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand
its domestic growth and rely less on exports.
    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and
reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in
the Canadian economy.

"&lt;Arabian Investment Banking Corp EC>
(Investcorp) signed for a 75 mln dlr revolving credit facility,
one of the lead managers &lt;Arab Banking Corp>, ABC, said.
    The facility was first mandated for 50 mln dlrs but was
increased before syndication to 60 mln when a lead group of six
banks was formed. Strong demand during syndication led to
another increase in the final amount to 75 mln dlrs.
    ABC said the facility, with a final lending syndicate of 32

    ABC as overall arranger said the facility will be used to
finance Bahrain-based Investcorp's general corporate funding

    These are through the issue of euronotes or advances by
tender, the extension of committed advances by underwriting
banks, or the issue of contingent obligations from a panel of
selected banks.
    The facility has a maturity of three years, with interest
on committed advances based on utilisation from 17.5 basis

basis points for two thirds and 22.5 for an amount above that
level.

"South Korea unveiled a shopping list of
2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy of
seeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade friction
with Washington.
    The government said this would help freeze this year's
trade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.
    ""The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last year
from 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion this
year but the government has taken steps to constrain it to the
seven billion dollar level,"" one Trade Ministry official told
Reuters.
    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was in
addition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last month
by a South Korean trade mission to the United States.
    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if South
Korea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should not
falter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.
    The statement said the government, state agencies and other
public institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,
computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical and
laboratory equipment and other products. ""This amounts includes
89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originally
reflected in their budgets,"" it added.
    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700
mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethylene
and other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics and
shipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.
    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had already
bought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn and
soybeans.
    This meant the country would buy from the United States
nearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports of
such commodities this year, they said.
    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,
accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrain
exports and cut export financing, the statement said.
    South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 trade
agents to deliver better after-sales services for imported
products and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products.

that it was axiomatic that despite market intervention, a

which balances its international trade and payments accounts.
    John Medlin, president and chief executive officer for the
First Wachovia Corp, said that ""substantial and rapid currency
devaluations usually are followed in time by surging price
inflation, spiralling interest rates and painful economic
austerity.""
    Speaking to a banking trade group, he also said the peak of
debt writeoff has not yet been reached.
    Medlin told the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade that
ultimately ""our nation's budget and trade deficits will be

consumption or through forced austerity imposed by a

warning that the classic laws of international economics still

    He also told the association that trying to reduce the

would not give lasting relief.
    ""However, the imposition and enforcement of fair trade
rules could help improve imbalances with nations which practice
protectionism and deception on us.""

    The impact on other financial markets was devastating.
    In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single day
decline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs
and in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80
pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40
points in hectic early trading.
    ""The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currency
problem. It is affecting all the markets,"" said one senior
trader at a major U.S. bank.
    Up until September of last year, international efforts to
redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a
dream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, world
interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check.
    In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to show
signs of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitive
tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of
cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war.
    ""The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is
really difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become an
inevitability,"" one currency dealer said.
    ""At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rate
increase, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by
Japan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing the
dollar,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4
to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise in
U.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in
the near future.
    But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rate
increases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts
overseas, would be too little, too late.
    ""They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have done
the trick then,"" said one currency analyst.
    ""If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure
not an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not
strength,"" added one trader.
    In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise
might place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and
tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate.
    A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the
protectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected
to pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises
President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with
during their summit later in the week.
    ""Politically, they can't really do it this week,"" said one
currency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize
the dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance.
    Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and
traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new
initiatives from this week's talks.
    At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan
will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to
outsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and
support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement.
    But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the
market's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears
of weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S.
Treasury refunding program.
    Japanese and European investors have traditionally played
an active role in these auctions, which are expected to total
28 to 29 billion dlrs.
    Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that
President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries
about currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget
deficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars.
    While similar action by former President Carter helped to
stabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly
reluctant to take such a step, economists said.
    This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker said, ""there might well be some
who would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence
by the U.S. in its own currency.""
    Baker added, ""therefore we don't think it's an appropriate
thing to do.""
    A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here
shared Baker's doubts. ""Dollar defending measures are very
unlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone and
lead to further speculative dollar selling,"" he said.
    Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to
stop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment.
    In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co concluded, ""the dollar should be left free to trade at
whatever level market forces produce.""

"Du Pont Co, reporting lower
first quarter profits, said a drop in energy earnings was only
partially offset by surging chemical and specialty products.
    Du Pont earned 391 mln dlrs, or 1.62 dlrs a share, in the
latest quarter, down from 404 mln, or 1.67 dlrs a share, in
1986's initial quarter.
    It had sales of 7.13 billion dlrs, down from 7.17 billion
last year and total revenues of 7.20 billion dlrs down from
7.29 billion dlrs.
    Du Pont said after-tax operating income for its chemical
and specialty products businesses totaled 393 mln dlrs in the
latest quarter, rising 55 pct from last year's first quarter
due to improved results from most businesses, notably fibers,
white pigments and specialty polymers.
    Results benefited from improved worldwide demand and lower
costs attributable to lower energy feedstock prices, earlier
restructurings, and efforts to improve productivity.
    It said sales of these businesses were up eight pct to 4.2
billion dlrs on a sales volume increase of five pct and three
pct higher average prices, reflecting a weaker dollar.
    Du Pont said after-tax operating income from the petroleum
segments dropped 64 pct from a year ago to 55 mln dlrs in the
latest quarter.
    These results reflect lower refined petroleum product
margins and lower worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gas
prices. Coal earnings were down 27 pct on lower prices.
    The company said it anticipates continued strong results
from chemicals and specialty products as worldwide demand
remains high. Improvement in petroleum will require flat or
improved crude oil prices and improved refined product margins.

"Exxon Corp chairman Lawrence Rawl said
total world energy consumption will continue to grow, but added
new oil discoveries worldwide are slowing down and can not
offset annual production.
    In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl said
oil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhanced
recovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics to
compensate for substantial declines in conventional oil
production.
    ""What our current outlook suggests is that total world
energy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an ever
more energy efficient world,"" Rawl said. But, he added, Exxon
projects that ""despite today's ample supplies, the world will
also be facing up to inherent limitations on the availability
of oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of the
world's energy needs.""
    The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives from
around the world that some synthetics projects could become
practical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range in
real terms.
    ""The question is when and how this will happen,"" he said.
""I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge but
will become commercial well below those we were thinking about
the last time oil prices moved substantially higher.""
    Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lower
prices because companies are investigating ""a new generation of
ideas that promise substantially lower costs"" and projects
begun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended.
    Rawl also said companies must find new and more effective
ways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields.
    ""It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even with
advanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -
the decline in worldwide oil discoveries,"" he said. ""So it is
essential to find a better way to recover more of the
discovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,
heat, and other techniques.""
    Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need some
assistance from government in developing synfuels technology.
""More importantly, they need to provide a political and
economic environment that is stable enough to allow the
developmental process to function effectively, he said.
    Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the best
interest of producing and consuming nations by allowing both
groups to plan for steady economic growth.
    He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only that
the economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only be
achieved if world oil prices ""stabilize within a reasonable
range.""
    ""Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirations
for income and encourage resource development in the producing
countries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth in
consuming nations,"" he said.
    The Exxon chairman also criticized ""the occasional attempt
of consuming nations to try to control domestic oil prices,
calling such protectionist measures disruptive to the world oil
market.

"French producers have withdrawn all
offers to sell more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar into European
Community intervention stocks, EC Commission sources said.
    They also said West German producers had now withdrawn the
last 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores on
April 1.
    The sales were made to protest against the level of export
restitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders.
    Last Friday, commission sources said the West German
producers had withdrawn all but 3,000 tonnes of their sales.
    The protest by European producers involved sales of 854,000
tonnes of sugar into intervention, of which 785,000 tonnes were
accepted by the commission.
    Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks before
receiving payment to withdraw the sugar.
    Their decision to withdraw the sugar follows what
commission sources have said is a slight shift in the
authority's stance in recent weeks. The commission last week
increased the maximum restitutions to within about 0.5 Ecus per
kilo of the prices which traders claim are needed to match

"President Reagan said he hoped the
United States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon.
    But he said the United States would do what is necessary to
see that other nations lived up to their trade agreements.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, he said, ""I hope that, before long, we can lift these
(Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will be
recorded as a small incident in the building of our
relationship.""
    But, Reagan added, ""we will do what is necessary to see that
other nations live up to their obligations and trading
agreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair.""
    Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300
mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States sent
a message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan ""trade bridge.""
  ""The final answer to the trade problems between America and
Japan is not more hemming and hawing, not more trade sanctions,
not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may be
needed as steps along the way - and certainly not more
unfulfilled agreements,"" he said.
    Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open markets
on both sides of the Pacific - ""and the sooner, the better.""
    Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing with
unfair trade practices met the need for both firmness and
finesse.
    He said trade legislation pending in Congress would be
dangerous because it would force the administration to use ""a
steamroller against unfair practices every time, no matter
whether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flatten
the entire house,"" he said.
    Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice in
Japan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.
    ""If our trade deficit is to come down, more must be done --
and is being done,"" he said.
    ""The change in the dollar's value is part of it, and since
the middle of last year, the actual volume of our exports had

"International Business Machines
Corp expects its new products and cost-cutting measures to have
an increasingly positive impact as 1987 proceeds, chairman John
Akers told the annual meeting.
    Akers repeated his assessment of the company's outlook when
first quarter results were announced last week that ""although
the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, we see some
encouraging signs.""
    He said IBM shipments in the first quarter exceeded the
1986 level, ""the first time that has happened since 1985.""
    Akers said that IBM will increase its emphasis on service
and support of customers this year and that by the end of 1987
it will have 20 pct more sales representatives and systems
engineers than two years ago.
    He said the company is accomplishing this by both moving as
many existing employees as possible into marketing and through
new hires.
    Akers said IBM will increase its U.S. software programming
workforce, both through retraining and hiring, by nearly six
thousands people over early 1985, to a yearend total of 26,000.
    Last year IBM announced that it would try to reduce its

"Senate majority leader Robert Byrd
said he wants the Senate to pass by late Friday a fiscal 1988
budget that starts reducing the flow of U.S. debt.
    The Democratic leader told a news conference and later the
Senate itself that the Senate would debate the measure today
even though technically the first procedural vote --on formally
bringing up the vital measure for action--would not take place
until tomorrow afternoon.
    The pending budget would cut some 38 billion dlrs from an
anticipated deficit that would occur without any action.
    Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole also said he wanted quick
action on the budget measure this week, before Friday afternoon
when some Republicans want to leave town.
    Dole said a Republican substitute probably would be offered
to the Democratic-written budget which would reduce the
estimated 1988 deficit of about 171 billion dlrs to about 134
billion dlrs, through cuts in defence and social spending and
some 18.5 billion dlrs in unspecified tax hikes in 1988.
    The House, also controlled by Democrats, has passed a
similar budget which would have to be reconciled with a Senate
plan. President Reagan's budget was defeated in the House.

    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a

"Blocking Canadian gas imports
would not serve the long-term interests of the United States,
said Martha Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, adding that the development of a freely open North
American energy market should be encouraged.
    ""I firmly believe that the long-term interest of U.S.
consumers would not be served by any attempt to promote a 'Made
in America' label for gas,"" she said at an oil and gas
conference.
    She said the commission recognizes the important role
Canadian gas plays in the American market, despite grumblings
among U.S. domestic producers of the competition from north of
the border.
    Recent figures show Canada shipped 2.48 billion Canadian
dlrs worth of gas to the U.S. in 1986, down sharply from the
3.91 billion dlr total in 1985.
    ""But we do seriously recognize the importance in the years
to come of the supplies of Canadian gas to U.S. markets,"" she
said. ""And even in the short term, competition is generally a
good thing,"" she added.
    She said the commission is concentrating on improving the
access to U.S. pipelines, something that would be of great
benefit to Canadian producers.
    Hesse said transportation of Canadian gas is already
improving, gas imports rising more than 21 pct in the first two
months of the year. But Hesse declined to comment in detail on
the controversial December order, known as the ""as billed issue"",
because it is the subject of a new hearing.
    The order, which is being fought by Canada, involves
barring U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from paying
certain Canadian shipping expenses.
    Hesse said the order was never intended ""as an attempt to
extend the arm of U.S. regulations across the border.""
    However, a senior Canadian government energy official
warned delegates the ruling could severely weaken Canadian gas
producers. ""Besides the extra territorial effect, there is the
potential that Canadian consumers and producers may end up
subsidizing the cost of transportation services originally
incurred on behalf of U.S. customers,"" said Robert Skinner, an
assistant deputy minister in Canada's energy department.

"The Reagan administration is expected to
face tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S.
interests, if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef
and citrus import controls by April, 1988, U.S. and Japanese
officials said.
    Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in
talks here last week, insisting that the quotas be abandoned by
April, 1988.
    But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan
will resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S.
suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining
the quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters.
    Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated with
Japan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo
round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and in
bilateral talks in 1984.
    Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at the
outset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead.
The current agreement calls for an increase in high quality
beef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to
126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes.
    Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States
will not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan has
been given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support
system and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said.
    Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and
citrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said.
    If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan,
as expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement,
which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988
deadline set by the U.S., officials said.
    In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beef
they will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S.
pressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive
and would be damaged by freer trade.
    Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small
farms which Japanese officials said must be protected from
cheap imports by use of the quota system.
    Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen's
Association is strongly supporting the tough administration
position, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent.
    This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef
exports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliable
business managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry
Promotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's
beef market has expanded at the expense of Australia.
    In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concerned
the U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would
become a riskier business, meat industry sources said.
    Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington
next week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in an
effort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan.
    The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue.
California's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to
Japan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas.
    A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is
concerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality oranges
from Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan.
    Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that fresh
oranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a
minimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production.
    This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with
smaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants to
maintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice
tastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange
juice, they said.
    One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officials
is that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance
by offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for
U.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas.
    Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and
citrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted during
the week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the
U.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice
issue which received most of the attention.
    Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness,
Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese side
have benefited from quotas but this will not stop the
administration from pressing for liberalization.
    And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall
more support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before,
because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus.
    ""We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation)
with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The times
have changed. The trade balance is much worse,"" Lyng said.

"The sliding value of the U.S. dollar
may soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage
for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top
executives with U.S. oil companies said.
    The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was
established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a
15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling.
    But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the
currency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr
price difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of
Unocal Corp &lt;UCL>.
    The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since
December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the
past two years.
    Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil
prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25
dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.
    ""I think June will be the critical month to see what they
do,"" said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World
Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in
June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions
that oil should be priced according to a basket of world
currencies instead of the U.S. dollar.
    E.H. Clark, chairman of &lt;Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi
kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater
world demand -- would drive any price increases.
    ""The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of
trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the
U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months
ago,"" Clark said in an interview. ""I'm betting on the Saudi
king's need to sustain revenues.""
    Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a
barrel by January one.
    However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey
reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase
OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth.
    Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based
on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of
OPEC oil against other energy sources.
    Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase
in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next
few years.
    Michel Moreau, a director of the &lt;Elf Aquitaine Group>,
said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a
consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were
necessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on
new production.
    The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the
cash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from
discounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau
said.
    ""I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the
production agreement will fall apart,"" he said. ""But this
threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line.
Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986.""
    Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, told Reuters
he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of
1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility.
    Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of
prices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the
cartel's production agreement.
    ""This is a year of testing,"" said Alfred Munk, manager of
foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). ""If they fail, there may
be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel.""
    French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud
said, ""Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one
percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,""
Vaillaud said.

"The prospect of renewed assaults on
the dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil
distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency,
monetary analysts and economists said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the
Reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing
yen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar.
    But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to
take such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources say
the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration.
    ""It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,""
Baker said last week. ""In our view there might well be some who
would view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack of
confidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we
don't think it's an appropriate thing to do.""
    But if the Reagan administration did announce measures,
they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort
to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action
to reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analysts
believe.
    And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter
administration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a
rise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct.
    The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key
rate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it could
hurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile
international debt situation.
    Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided
over its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement
could come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    ""It would give some real focus to the visit, and it might
steady the dollar and prevent it from going down,"" said Charles
Taylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
    But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the
Reagan administration would resort to measures which would
bring to mind the troubles of President Carter.
    Until very recently, the current administration has urged a
lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while
Carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic
policies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies are
increasingly in question.
    The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was a
resounding success. ""This package really gave credibility to the
administration to get the dollar up,"" said Robert Hormats,
vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S.
economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations.
    The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around
188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen.
    ""The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is
evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really
doing very little,"" Hormats said of statements to support the
dollar by U.S. officials.
    Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials
think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying
the dollar has declined far enough.
    Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc
bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support
for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, who
had lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes.
    The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount
rate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the
International Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to
other IMF members. 
    It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines
with other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold
sales.
    Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is now
vice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, ""I think it's very
unlikely they would do that now.""
    He argued that it was politically difficult to take action
to support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still
to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies.
    But most analysts believe a currency support package would
only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade
imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers.
    It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of
the seven major industrial democracies -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline
slightly further for a package to have impact. He said the
seven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged
too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment.
    ""I think we're nearing a point when they would feel
(politically) comfortable doing this,"" Hormats said.
    Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act
firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the
pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear
of fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress.
    But Hormats said ""there will be a point at which the
government of the United States shows it does give a damn for
the dollar.""

in the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman of
Reading and Bates Drilling Co.
     Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that
contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that
oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were
nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
     He said local connections to the nation whose waters are
being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the
market.
     ""We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages
in nations in which they had worked successfully for years
essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or
a locally-built rig,"" he said.
     Tappmeyer, who is president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend
would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.
     He added that international contractors will increasingly
find their role restricted to regions that require special
expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe
environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.
     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to
provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming
decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing
themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty
providing financing out of cash flow.
     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect
as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning
business.
     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up
by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction
costs.
     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of
rigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologically
advanced rigs within a few years.
     He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely to
benefit from new developments in technology, adding that by
2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, too
cold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

"European Community (EC) leaders hope
to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on
reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC
agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here
this morning.
    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen
met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to
plan a new initiative.
    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC
farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the
lack of progress in the talks so far this week.
    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough
package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in
farmers' returns for many crops this year.
    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but
are only this week getting down to serious negotiations.
    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by
2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC
stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger
margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported
oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade
relations with the United States.
    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed
to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched
positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in
steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.
    They said he could also be treading a minefield if he
sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over
plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed
in a notional common currency, are translated into the
currencies of member states.
    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he
would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,
saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency
nations.
    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a
paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a
compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.
    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers
like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional
rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as
unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely
difficult to bridge.
    They agreed with EC farmers' union association president
Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June
appeared to be the best that could be hoped for.

"Currency futures at the International
Monetary Market (IMM) are likely to consolidate near current
levels in nervous trading conditions over the next few days,
although underlying sentiment remains positive, currency
analysts said.
    ""Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels,"" said
Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills.
    Traders are unwilling to establish either long or short
positions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming trade
talks and U.S. trade legislation, they said.
    Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President
Reagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensions
between their two countries, while at the same time the
Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on
a controversial trade bill.
    ""Unless something really surprising comes out of the
Nakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142
(yen) and 1.83 (marks),"" Mills said.
    The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels are
about 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about
0.5500 in June marks, she said.
    June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marks
finished the day at 0.5602.
    Mills said, however, that ""the chances of them (Reagan and
Nakasone) coming up with something new are limited."" One
possibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but ""they
probably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate.""
    Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the Federal
Reserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system has
heightened sentiment that the money-policy making body has
already tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible,
analysts said.
    Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollar
has been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of the
meeting rather than reaction to the White House statement
Monday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currency
analyst Earl Johnson.
    Traders ""are worried about the outcome of the talks between
Reagan and Nakasone,"" and as the talks are late in the week,
the market may not get a chance to react to any developments
until Monday, Johnson said.
    Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broad
range between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen.
    Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rally
in the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen,
at this point is overbought.
    ""The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market,"" and
investment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely to
flow into Europe, Bilson said.
    The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will be
sterling, Bilson said.
    ""Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates,
despite the half point rate cut,"" Bilson said. Major U.K. banks
lowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct.
    In addition to a favorable interest rate spread which
should attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and the
strong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also make
British investments attractive.
    Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment by
Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pct
annual cut in imports from countries with an excessive trade
surplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair trade
barriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, would
likely pressure the yen, Bilson said.
    Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass,
but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanese
markets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contracts
with U.S. manufacturers.

"A study by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development says it may take years
to resolve the huge economic imbalances now plaguing the world
economy, U.S. and western officials said.
    The paper was expected to stimulate policy debate among
senior officials of leading industrial nations preparing for
next month's annual meeting of finance ministers in Paris.
    The May 11-13 ministerial meeting of the 24-nation OECD, a
forum for coordinating economic policies, has taken on added
significance in view of the difficulties dogging the attempts
of major nations to achieve joint goals.
    Despite two meetings of the seven leading industrial powers
-- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada -- pledges to change policy have still to be
turned into action.
    As a result, financial markets have been unusually unstable
and have focussed their attention on every international
meeting for clues that change is in the air.
    The study concludes that there needs to be much greater
fiscal action by the United States, West Germany and Japan to
reduce their massive trade imbalances, a U.S. official said.
    ""We looked at what we could do to get from here to there.
We've got to continue cutting the deficit, and there needs to
be domestic expansion (in West Germany and Japan),"" the official
said, noting that significant actions are called for.
    Officials noted the study strongly underscores the need for
action by West Germany and Japan.
    Seperately, western officials said they understood that
U.S. overtures to Japan and West Germany to cut their
short-term interest rates have been rebuffed for now.
    Such rate reductions would have helped stabilize the steep
decline of the dollar, by widening the difference between bond
yields in the United States, on the one hand, and in Japan and
West Germany on the other.
    One official said that while the policy actions called for
were similar to those urged by the seven, the study shows ""it's
going to take several years to resolve (the trade
imbalances).""
    The OECD has set three pct as the necessary target for
average annual growth in the industrial world if trade
imbalances are to be corrected and the Third World debt crisis
kept under control.
    The study strongly implies these targets will not be met
without major action by the three leading nations, officials
said.
    Equally, it suggests that without major fiscal expansion by
Bonn and Tokyo, and a corresponding deep reduction in the U.S.
budget deficit, the current trend of an upturn in U.S. interest
rates and a weakening dollar will go uncorrected.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker says the dollar's deep
decline alone will shave only 15 billion dlrs off the roughly
140 billion dlrs U.S. deficit in goods and services this year.
    But the study group also found that progress has been made
and the seven main nations are moving in the right direction.
    In Paris this February, the seven agreed that fiscal
actions by the three major powers would help them stabilize
currencies around levels ruling then.
    The Reagan administration, this week facing the prospect of
a tough trade bill aimed at curbing foreign trade surpluses,
also promised to fight protectionism.
    The officials said Washington must move ahead with budget
deficit cuts of around 36 billion dlrs, a figure set as a goal
by the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives.
    They also called for significant increases in the budget
deficits of Japan and West Germany. Since the study group met,
Japan has announced a roughly 35 billion dlr supplementary
budget which was warmly welcomed by Washington.
    Nonetheless there is caution over both the timing and the
content of the proposed Japanese budget.
    Financial markets, unconvinced by yet another Japanese
promise of action, have pushed the yen sharply higher against
the dollar.
    While no West German fiscal action is promised before
January 1988, U.S. officials would welcome such a move. ""We'd
love them to accelerate their tax cuts,"" one official said.
    West German economic growth fell steeply in the first
quarter this year, but the official said Bonn has reassured
U.S. officials they expect growth to pick up again.
    If faster German growth fails to emerge, Bonn could find
itself under pressure to speed up tax cuts planned for early
1988 when leaders of the seven meet in Venice this June.

"A Soviet geologist said scientists need
to coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits to
help identify global formations that would indicate other
potential discoveries of oil and gas reserves.
    Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleum
geology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the World
Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be
improved through new and more sophisticated technology.
    ""We should emphasize that when having the data about
petroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible to
clarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gas
prospects,"" Semenovich said. ""However, much work should be done
to coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gas
prospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins.""
    Sharing the information could help geologists better
predict regional trends and underground formations that
indicate the presence of oil or gas, he said.
    Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the
potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need
to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine
unexplored regions.
    The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrels
of oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billion
barrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources are
estimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of the
total ultimate reserves, Semenovich said.
    ""There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world
and, as far as the already known basins, one continues to find
additional reserves,"" he said, noting that Antarctica has been
virtually ignored. ""The existing estimate of potential
resources of the world may need to be enlarged.""
    To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists will
need to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laser
spectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other
techniques, he said.
    He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13
pct of all offshore reserves.
    Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil
and gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be
discovered and placed in production during the next 50 years.
    After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil
production was increasing. ""The difficulties of 1985 have been
overcome and we're now back to normal production,"" he said.
    The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, had
experienced drilling and technical problems that cut total
liquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1
mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced an
estimated 12.3 mln barrels.
    When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal
gasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said
the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves
in the region.
    Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil
prices the coal gasification process would become economic
again. ""It's too expensive for the time being,"" Semenovich
said.
    ""Theoretical development is underway and tests are being
run. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part of
the energy industry,"" he said.

"Hong Kong has not taken unfair
advantage of its currency's link with the U.S. Dollar, Hong
Kong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annual
meeting of the Asian Development Bank here.
    He said: ""We have taken the rough with the smooth, having to

terms, but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined.""
He said that since the establishment of the link in 1983, Hong
Kong's trade had been broadly in balance. This year a modest
deficit was expected.
    ""Under the link, Hong Kong's entirely free and open economy
continues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances, but the
burden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domestic
interest rates, money supply and price levels,"" Nendick said.

price we pay for the stability of our currency against the U.S.
Dollar,"" he said.

"The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today wound up a three-day meeting which was marked by
criticism of the ADB from both rich and poor member nations.
    In speech after speech, the 20-year-old ADB was charged
either with not doing enough to help countries in the region,
or with funding projects which were not worthwhile.
    The attacks often, but not always, broke down along
developed and developing country lines.
    The former, which provide the ADB with money, generally
emphasized the need for quality projects.
    The ADB was not even spared criticism from its host country
and largest shareholder, Japan.
    ""I am not 100 pct satisfied with the performance of the ADB,""
Japanese finance ministry deputy director-general Fumiya
Iwasaki told Reuters.
    He said the Bank had only approved five pct more new loans
in 1986 than in 1985. He hoped for a return to the more rapid
growth rates of earlier years.
    ""The Asian economy is now changing. The ADB should adapt
itself to those changes,"" he said.
    But supporters of the ADB said it already was changing, and
Iwasaki made it clear Japan welcomed the steps being taken by
the ADB's president Masao Fujioka.
    ""So far, we have confidence in Mr Fujioka's leadership,""
Iwasaki said.
    To spur demand for loans, the ADB has restructured its
country and agricultural departments to enable it to identify
the needs of developing member countries more quickly.
    But some delegates said the ADB was putting too much
emphasis on the need to give out more money, and not enough on
checking the quality of the projects involved.
    ""The success of the Bank should not be measured by the
volume of its lending but by its contribution to the
development process,"" chief U.S. Delegate Charles H. Dallara
told the meeting.
    He said: ""Project quality is an area which has attracted
attention recently and on which the United States has expressed
strong views. Although over the years the majority of ADB loans
have been sound, we have had problems with some of the projects
brought before the board of directors lately.""
    Australia voiced similar concerns.
    Australian delegate C. J. Hurford said: ""Bad projects
benefit neither the Bank nor its borrowers. They damage the
Bank's reputation and ultimately lessen support from donor
countries and capital markets.""
    There were also criticisms of proposals from developing
countries that the ADB make more of its loans dependent on
economic reforms in Third World nations.
    ""We are concerned with the Bank's increasing preoccupation
with dialogue,"" said India's delegate, S. Venkitaramanan.
    ""We have expressed our unhappiness with the insistence of
multi-lateral agencies on global prescriptions,"" he said.

"Civil strife in Sri Lanka will
make the economy's growth rate in 1987 its slowest in a decade,
Sri Lankan finance minister Ronnie de Mel said here.
    He told Reuters in an interview that he expected gross
domestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said it
averaged five pct over the past three years.
    For the first two years after the present troubles began in
1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconuts
and rice kept up, he said.
    Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state.
    De Mel said: ""Private sector production in fact grew by 25
pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took a
turn for the worse.""
    He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their
1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell.
    ""There was also a decline in income from tourism and
remittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East.""
    He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oil
prices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings.
    ""To add to all this we have had, between January and March
this year, the worst drought I have seen in my life,"" he said.
    De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agricultural
production.
    He said because of the fighting in the country, defence
expenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of
70 billion rupees.
    Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 from
the World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprises
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), he said.
    ""We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund for
another 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facility
and a compensatory financing facility to balance our export
revenue cuts,"" de Mel said.
    He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded in
keeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs by
avoiding borrowing from commercial banks.
    ""Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our total
foreign debt,"" he said.
    He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearing
completion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports.
    ""The project will more than treble our hydro-electric power
from 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts,"" de Mel said.
    He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,
which is in the north-central part of the island. It was
expected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectly
provide employment for 500,000 landless families.
    De Mel said Tamil guerrillas were waging a war of attrition
in the island's north and east.

"China is likely to borrow up to
300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
president Masao Fujioka said.
    The loans would be China's first from the ADB.
    ""I think there will be at least one loan to China this year,
and possibly a second,"" Fujioka told a news conference at the
end of the ADB's annual meeting here.
    Asked how large the loans were likely to be, Fujioka said
he thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each.
    China is the ADB's newest member, joining in March 1986.
    China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and the
U.S.. It was elected to the ADB's 12-member board yesterday.
    Fujioka announced that the ADB's 1989 meeting would be held
in Peking. The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila.
    Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates' suggestions
that it set up a task force of experts to define its future
role. The ADB's performance was criticised by both its rich and
poor members at the three-day meeting just finished.
    External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy for
the 1980s, Fujioka said. He said a similar study for the 1990s
would be useful, but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet.
    He said the ADB had already responded to members like the
U.S., Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects.
    ""We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen its
research capability,"" Fujioka said.
    He said ADB lending had declined, but ""the amount is not the
only thing that counts. We also want to be a catalyst by taking
innovative measures like the promotion of the private sector.""
    Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the U.S. And
Japan over their voting power in the ADB.
    Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher than
those of the U.S., So Japanese delegates asked for their voting
power to reflect this. The U.S. Opposed the move.
    ""It is advisable and wise, for institutions like the ADB to
be viable, that there be a reasonable relationship between
financial contributions and voting power,"" Fujioka said.
    But he indicated the problem remained unresolved.
    Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam to
resume lending which was cut off in 1974, Fujioka re-iterated
his view that conditions there were not conducive to banking.
    Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam, but said there
had been no pressure from the U.S. Or any other country on the
issue.
    He also spoke about demands by the bank's financiers that
it take a more active role in prodding borrowers into making
economic policy changes.
    ""The initiative must come from the borrowing country. We
don't accept that we impose policy conditions. There must be a
two-way consultation,"" he said.

"Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have
risen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officials
attribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and the
influx of speculative funds.
    The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, compare
with 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said.
    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: ""The
rising reserves will certainly intensify our trade friction
with the U.S.""
    A central bank official, who declined to be named, said
Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S.
Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion a
year ago.
    The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong,
Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise of
the reserves, he said, but declined to give figures.
    Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs had
entered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of the
funds were remitted through different channels, including the
black market, since the start of this year, they said.
    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council
for Economic Planning and Development, said he expects the
reserves to rise in the next few months because of the
continuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steady
appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.
    ""The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market,
cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls have
achieved little success,"" he said.
    Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some
1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bid
to encourage more imports, especially the U.S.
    More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, including
televisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigerators
will be announced in a month or two, Li said.
    Li's colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government will
send several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy about
one billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, power
equipment, grains and precision tools.
    ""We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with the
U.S.,"" he said.
    Taiwan's trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S.
Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to
3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billion
a year ago, official statistics show.
    The surplus has increased U.S. Pressure on Taiwan for a
faster appreciation of its currency, which has risen by about
18 pct since September 1985.
    It opened at 33.10 to the U.S. Dollar today.

strongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,
while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3
billion marks a year earlier.
    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,
but an office statement said that the current account surplus
had also risen in real terms from February.
    However, it attributed this partly to the fact that
payments to the European Community had been brought forward in
February, with the result that transfers abroad in March were
unusually low.
    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93
billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pct
compared with March 1986.
    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higher
than in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.
    Other data reported in the current account balance showed
there was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,
a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mln
mark deficit in transfer payments.
    The Statistics Office said that in the first three months
of this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marks
from 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.
    The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marks
from 15.6 billion.

"The Soviet Union's first official
observer at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said he came away
from this week's ADB annual meeting with a favourable
impression but that no decision has been made on whether the
Soviet Union should join as a full member.
    Yurij V. Ponomarev, international managing director of the
State Bank, said he will file a formal report when he returns
to Moscow, but it will not contain any recommendation on
membership. ""We haven't started any process with a view toward
membership,"" he said.
    Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance,
saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow.
Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB's
annual meeting as an observer, Soviet bankers have come to
meetings in the past as guests, he said.
    Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overall
strategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve the
functioning of the Soviet economy.
    Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by a
senior U.S. Official, who warned that Soviet membership in the
ADB would cause serious operational problems.
    ""How would the ADB, for instance, use the (Soviet) rouble as
a basis for expanding its capital?"" asked the U.S. Official, who
declined to be identified.
    Ponomarev said: ""It is far too premature to speculate on the
potential difficulties that might be involved if we applied for
membership.""
    In order to become a member, Moscow would have to gain the
backing of two-thirds of the board of governors representing
three-quarters of the voting power of member countries.
Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share.

"Central Bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
defended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of its
foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similar
policies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan.
    The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are the
world's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90
pct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks.
    Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call on
Monday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked the
government to diversify into other currencies, including yen,
marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses.
    The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S.
Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwan
dollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45.
    They said they expected the losses to continue because of
the rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.
    Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollars
like other private banks or enterprises because such trading
would be speculative and risky.
    ""The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widely
used among trading nations,"" he added.
    Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreign
exchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspend
them.
    The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet for

"Thailand's gross domestic product will
expand five pct this calendar year, up from 3.8 pct in 1986,
despite a projected slight decline in agricultural output due
to drought, the Bank of Thailand said.
    Central bank spokesman Siri Karncharoendi told reporters
the Thai economy clearly recovered in the first quarter from
the lingering effects of the 1984-85 recession.
    He said the industrial sector is expected to expand 5.5 pct
this year, up from five pct in 1986. Agricultural output is
projected to grow 2.8 pct after 1.5 pct contraction in 1986.
    He said January/March imports grew 19.2 pct to 70.7 billion
baht, in response to an improving domestic market, compared
with a nine pct decline to 59.3 billion a year ago. Non-oil
imports grew 24.8 pct to 60.2 billion baht while oil imports
declined 5.6 pct to 10.5 billion.
    First quarter exports increased 12.7 pct to 63.2 billion
baht compared with 14.4 pct and 56.1 billion a year ago.
    Siri said he expects the trade deficit to widen to about 30
billion baht this year from 17.4 billion in 1986. The current
account, which last year posted a surplus of 3.5 billion baht,
is projected to return to a 7.4 billion deficit in 1987.
    He said overall January/March lending by the Thai banking
system grew a strong nine pct to 577.9 billion baht, up from
4.7 pct growth in the previous quarter and 5.8 pct for the
whole of 1986.
    He said the Thai consumer price index rose 1.8 pct in the

with the economy picking up, inflation is expected to rise to
2.5 pct this year from 1.9 pct for the whole 1986.

"European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply
divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the
EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns.
    Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a news
conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting
out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, with
the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed
negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18.
    But diplomats said the talks this week had served little
more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex
package of measures proposed by the commission.
    The executive body has proposed measures which would result
in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct.
    Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and
imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European
currency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes in
the conversion of EC common farm prices into national
currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and
Dutch farmers.
    De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences
between EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currency
measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated
measures.
    But he told journalists, ""We have used this meeting to reach
the point at which real negotiations can start at the next
meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our
procedures took much longer than planned.""
    Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package
by April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached in
practice.
    Diplomats said on all the points there were widely
diverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, the
countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals
price cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax.
    However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the
monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to
resolve. ""This is a very tough political nut, and because of the
very nature of the problem there is no technical solution,"" he
said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his
proposals to make an agreement easier.
    However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he had
little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of
his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led by
Germany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding.
    EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the
EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five
billion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commission
farm price package is adopted in its entirety.

"Belgian Agriculture Minister Paul de

light of objections made by certain EC member states.
    De Keersmaeker, current chairman of the EC farm ministers'
council, was speaking after a three-day meeting of ministers at
which the tax proposal was one of the key themes.
    He said he would review the position as part of plans to
present compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price package
to the next meeting, starting in Brussels on May 18.
    De Keersmaeker, who said there was ""a great deal of
resistance in many delegations"" to the tax, declined to say what
aspects of the proposals he would review.
    However, EC Commission sources said they are expected to
include the question of whether it should apply to marine oils.
    They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax, to
be set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne, if these oils, of which
they are major producers, were excluded.
    The sources said, however, that Britain, the Netherlands
and West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax,
partly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exports
could provoke transatlantic trade friction.
    They said that, if these three countries held firm to this
position, they would be able to block the proposal under the
EC's majority voting mechanism.

"It is vitally important that the
industrialised countries of the world work towards convergence
of their economies and economic policies, U.S. Ambassador to
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Edward Streator said.
    He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world was
changing rapidly and national attitudes had to alter
accordingly if growth was not to falter and world depression
set in.
    Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and services
and technology was an overriding goal, he added.
    World financial flows were now 12 times as large as
traditional trade flows, the importance of commodities was
declining rapidly, countries such as those on the Pacific Rim
were becoming major growth areas, and the labour element in
manufacturing was declining sharply, Streator said.
    All these factors were creating major social and economic
pressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditional
attitudes, he added.
    ""Agriculture is a prime target for change.One of the first
things we must do is disconnect farm subsidies from production,""
Streator said.
    At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time there
would be an attempt to agree global principles to help reduce
this major agricultural problem, Streator said.
    ""However, of equal and vital importance in reducing the
world's dangerous slide towards protectionism will be the
outcome of the new round of talks under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),"" Streator added.
    Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding, who also spoke briefly
at the lunch, stressed the importance of coordinating national
policies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid decline
into bilateralism and global protectionism.

"The Swiss National Bank is
prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if
the action can be properly coordinated with other central
banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man
directorate, said.
    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention
to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in
exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in
economic policy.
    However, intervention could send signals that would
contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.
    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation
with other central banks, especially where convincing
coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser
said.
    He said currency developments could not simply be talked
into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field
of economic policy.
    ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the
dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and
a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are
unavoidable,"" he said.
    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly
in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had
intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last
October.
    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability
lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in
an improvement in international economic policy coordination.
    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt
switches in economic policy and give priority to price
stability.
    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view
that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible
with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target
is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.
    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply
against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its
money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with
the result that inflation surged.
    ""Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at
any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank
necessary,"" he said.

    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would
engineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.
    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting
speculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,
has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also
broaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.
    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest
rate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.
    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take
pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.
    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the
trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.
    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a
renewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc
rate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.
    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct
this week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on
the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to
a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.
    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above
140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount
rate speculation.
    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would
put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday
the U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,
adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct
discount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita said was not under consideration.
    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central
bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank
favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow
suit if it happened.
    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected
phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key
money market rates in the next three to six months.
    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on
repurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around
3.70 pct for much of April.
    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid
said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,
either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest
rate, allowing the market to set the rate.
    ""I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,"" he said.
    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate
would have little impact on the German economy or fundamental
exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.
    ""A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I
think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was
accompanied by other measures elsewhere,"" he said.
    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that
the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the
Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the
moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.
    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an
interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That
should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,
they said.
    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest
rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to
speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.
    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the
DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the
Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.
    ""I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little
it would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,"" he said. But a
sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the
Bundesbank to take some action, he said.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in
interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.
    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the
monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather
than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response
to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make
the mark and mark investments less attractive.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors
would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which
have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which
would take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.
    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead
investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next
move would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying
bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.
    There are so far no signs that German investors are
switching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank
hopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank
economist Hermann Remsperger said.
    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates
and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into
German bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.
    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland
in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would
continue to drift lower in many European countries.
    ""The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain
but more limited in West Germany, where we could see some
consolidation,"" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match
any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further
against the mark, he said.
    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in
U.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the
pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.

"The Swiss National Bank is
prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if
the action can be properly coordinated with other central
banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man
directorate, said.
    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention
to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in
exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in
economic policy.
    However, intervention could send signals that would
contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.
    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation
with other central banks, especially where convincing
coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser
said.
    He said currency developments could not simply be talked
into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field
of economic policy.
    ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the
dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and
a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are
unavoidable,"" he said.
    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly
in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had
intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last
October.
    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability
lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in
an improvement in international economic policy coordination.
    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt
switches in economic policy and give priority to price
stability.
    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view
that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible
with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target
is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.
    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply
against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its
money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with
the result that inflation surged.
    ""Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at
any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank
necessary,"" he said.

"A 0.4 pct rise in the March U.S. index
of leading indicators points to continued moderate U.S. real

    The average workweek, raw materials prices, and money
supply detracted from the index.
    Economists noted that the index signals the direction but
not the magnitude of changes in gross national product.

"The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it
did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget
for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said.
    He told Parliament that ""all the indicators that have been
published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are
doing even better than I suggested then."" The budget was
unveiled on March 17.
    ""The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out
lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower
than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance
of payments is also performing better, so far, than I
predicted.""
    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end
of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at
the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0
billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.
    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987
of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said ""output
appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster.""
    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, ""by the
end of this year we will have registered the longest period of
steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British
economy has known since the (Second World) War.""
    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic
rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.
    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to
further cut the standard rate to ""no more than 25p."" He said that
that objective ""should not take too long to achieve.""
    Turning to policies proposed by political opposition
parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would
entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.
    That, he said, ""would require either a doubling of the basic
rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of
(valued added tax) VAT,"" which is currently 15 pct.
    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative
government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.
    ""Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined
in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no
responsible government could conceivably take any other
position,"" he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of
planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.
    Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation
can often produce higher, not lower, revenues  ""thus leading to
the scope for still further reductions in taxation.""
    Lawson said ""inheritance tax is expected this year to yield
almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did
in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80
pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct.""
    He said that ""the greatly increased yield of Corporation
Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is
clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I
introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company
profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised
world.""

"The oil price collapse of 1986 put
development of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extra
heavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-term
economic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.
    ""Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils
exceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located
in Venezuela,"" Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de
Venezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.
    ""And this virtually unused resource represents a prime
example of the need to invest in technology to ensure
tomorrow's energy future,"" he added.
    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of
light oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not
many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.
    ""Improved technology has the potential for reducing the
capital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil
development projects by 30 pct or more,"" Gordon Willmon, VP and
general manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources
Canada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.
    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last
summer as OPEC members increased production to gain market
share, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPEC
production/pricing agreement is basically in tact.
    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply
90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25
pct of remaining petroleum resources.
    ""So future demand increasingly will be met from the various
forms of heavy oil,"" Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources
include extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and
oil shales (in sedimentary rock).
     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil
development economical, including real and stable growth in
crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved
technology.
    He said he expects ""all pieces of the puzzle to fit
together."" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very
sensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important
factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the
price of crude.
    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight
dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for
an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.
    He said the current price differential is only about five
dlrs a barrel.
    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20
dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a
broad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for
resources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,
which would permit commercial development despite a lower crude
oil price outlook.
    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery
by steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the
viscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a
pipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce
current captial investment and operating costs.
    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not
encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a
meaningful and sustained recovery.
   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production
is fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather
than in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP
Operations &lt;Syncrude Canada Ltd>.
    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range
from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic
crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and
nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.
    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that
everything required to build and operate the plant must come
from outside the area.
    Willmon also said, ""Public policy could best help by
providing financial support to offset the high cost of
technology developmemt which would help generate projects that
could survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of
time.""
    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, ""The Reagan
Administration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to
continuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in
the marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and
development.""

"The Securities Exchange Commission
decided to allow the Midwest Stock exchange to trade 25 stocks
currently listed on the National Securities Dealers Association
Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system.
    The SEC's unanimous decision granting so-called unlisted
trading privileges to the 25 NASDAQ securities will allow the
Midwest Exchange to begin trading the issues by May 18 under a
one-year pilot program.
    Unlisted trading privileges allow trading of stocks on an
exchange other than the one on which the stocks are listed.
    Before it would approve the Midwest Exchange request for
the unlisted trading privileges, the SEC had insisted that it
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, come
up with a way of reporting and combining information on stock
prices and transactions.
    SEC officials said they needed to be assured that 
information on the trading in and price of the securities would
be in one place, for accuracy and consistency.
    But since the exchanges still have not come with a master
plan, the SEC approved an interim plan under which NASDAQ
terminals would be put on the Midwest Exchange floor.
    All trades in the 25 over the counter securities done on
the Midewest Exchange will be quoted in the NASDAQ system as
well as on the Midwest Exchange under the interim plan.
    The NASD, Midwest Exchange and several other exchanges have
said they are working on a master plan for consolidating the
reporting of price quotes and other information on stocks now
traded on NASDAQ and listed on one or more exchanges.
    But an SEC official said such a new master reporting system
is not expected to be in place until early next year. The
Midwest Exchange proposed the interim reporting plan so that it
can begin unlisted trading immediately, he said.
    The 25 securities to be traded on the Midwest Exchange are
the first over the counter securities to be traded on any
exchange besides the NASDAQ. Some issues listed on exchanges,
however, are traded on the NASDAQ.
    The 25 securities had an average dollar volume last year of
2.4 billion dlrs and made up 18 pct of the dollar volume of all
the securities quoted on the NASD's National Market System.

"Egypt has embarked on reforms sought by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank by
raising the price of diesel oil and other types of transport
fuels.
    The energy price increases were the first visible measures
taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans.
    Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of
gas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, an
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said
fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5
pounds.
    Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five
piasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters.
    The government is expected also to act soon, possibly as
early as next weekend, to simplify the country's complex
exchange rate system, bankers said.
    Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound
was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor
governments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to one
billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to
help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee
rescheduling by western governments, the main creditors.
    Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on
World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy,
communications and other sectors which have been under
negotiation for several months, western diplomats said.
    The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing
for President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to a
multi-party political system and peace with Israel and
strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal.
    Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely to
lead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of the
government's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said.
    But the new prices are still below world market levels.
    There was no announcement of increases in more politically
sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used for
cooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they
would stay the same.
    Official comment was not available on speculation among
bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker
with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars
into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated
free market.
    The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in
which 10 commercial banks, including the four state-owned
banks, would decide the pound's value every day.
    The official ""incentive rate,"" currently set by the Central
Bank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15
on the free market.
    Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates
around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim
of curbing the free market.

"Better times for the hard hit
natural gas industry remains two to three years away as a
seemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress sales
and prices, industry officials said.
    An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadian
pricing policies and unusually warm winters are working against
a quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate and
government speakers told an energy conference here.
    ""We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to price
and volume,"" said Michael Phelps, vice president of &lt;Westcoast
Transmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.
    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by a
sharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increase
should help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.
    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market should
rise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of the
decade, nearly double 1986's total.
    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent on
the U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gas
production is sent.
    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest Pipeline
Corp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could be
in balance by 1990.
    He said while North American demand for natural gas has
flattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return to
more colder winters in the next few years could quickly tighten
supplies.
    ""Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of the
bubble,"" Wadlington told Reuters in an interview.
    However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized by
Canadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent the
country from participating in the market's recovery.
    The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves a
ruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.
pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadian
shipping expenses.
    The Canadian government believes the ruling could severely
weaken the country's gas producers. ""Besides the
extra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadian
producers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost of
transportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.
customers,"" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister in
Canada's energy department.
    But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference the
ruling was really intended ""to assure equal, fair and open
competition in the pricing of natural gas sold within our
country -- whatever the source of the gas.""
    Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergence
of a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market.
    Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking to
limit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would work
against the long-term interest of American consumers. ""We truly
constitute a North American market,"" she said. ""Natural gas
moving through pipelines recognizes no boundries.""

"Offshore drilling for oil and gas will
be moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L.
Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the
Marine Technology Society.
     Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology
Conference that the technology existed to drill exploratory
wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.
     But he added that as the industry moves more and more to
floating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported
structures, the financial risks involved were greater.
     He said such projects involved six to nine year time
frames, and there was a ""reluctance for people to stick their
necks too far out.""
     Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory
well, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic
offshore New Jersey in 1984.
     The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the
Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana.
     Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for
underwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of
water offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January.
     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the
Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of
companies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>,
Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's &lt;X> Marathon Oil Co,
Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and &lt;Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of
them testing new deep-water technologies.
     Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72
system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who
last year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection
in order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties.
     They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill
oil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that
continued development of the project is essential to their
ability to get out of their financial crisis.
     Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a
bankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project.
     The Penrod system involves a controversial floating
production platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on
the ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the
wellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700
feet of water.
     Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project,
other than to note that it involves so many new technologies,
it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within
a specific time frame.
     He also said he believed the potential production from the
project could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have
projected
.
     The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have
exaggerated the potential of the project.
     ""They're in the ballpark,"" he said, of the numbers, adding
that he did not have enough information to comment further.

"Demand for natural gas has failed to
grow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because of
concerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the United
States, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources.
    ""Natural gas is not free to compete,"" said Larry Makovich,
director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, ""problems
on pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weigh
heavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas.""
    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,
agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fear
of unresolved regulatory issues.
    ""The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet
firmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas
from producers to consumers,"" he said.
     Michael German, an economist with the American Gas
Association, said while a significant amount of gas was now
replacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding
the marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas
consumption data is not available until June.
    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand
fell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not
able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.
    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were
concerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital
investment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on
spot purchases.
    ""With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural
gas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,"" he
said, adding that compared with the same period last year,
January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for
industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.
    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas
to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.
    ""March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas
consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity
generation,"" he said.
     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual
fuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day
from the same period a year ago.
    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices
had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric
utilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the
role of natural gas was over-stated.
    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the
fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream
in the last few years.
    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected
the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. 
    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct
of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,
he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986
from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil
prices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture
only two pct of the share, Makovich said.
    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, ""Nevertheless,
outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is
significant in a glutted market.""

"Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, of Tokyo,
plans to open a new Canadian company after a June 30
deregulation of the Ontario equity market is implemented, Daiwa
Securities general manager for Canada Hajimu Watanabe told
Reuters in reply to query.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange earlier announced Daiwa became
the first Japanese company to acquire an exchange seat, paying
361,000 Canadian dlrs, the highest price ever paid.
    ""This is a prelude of our establishment of a new Canadian
company,"" Watanabe said.
    Watanabe said Daiwa's new Canadian brokerage house will
concentrate on investment in Canadian stocks by Japanese
investors, Canadians acquiring Japanese equity, and government
and corporate financing, mainly in the Canadian bond market.
    ""We have now a huge amount of demand on the part of Japanese
investors for Canadian stocks,"" Watanabe said.
    ""So if we can get membership of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
that should support our business very much,"" he added. Daiwa's
application for exchange membership is subject to approval by
other members and the Ontario Securities Commission.
    When asked, Watanabe declined to specify how much capital
Daiwa, the world's second largest investment dealer, would
invest in its Canadian subsidiary.
    ""It is quite confidential at this moment, but say our main
intention is not to create any friction with the Canadian
houses,"" Watanabe said.
    He said Daiwa could easily set up its new unit with one
billion Canadian dlrs of capital, ""but we are starting at quite
a moderate figure.""
    ""But small means quite big in Canadian terms,"" he added.
    Daiwa, which established a representative office in Canada
in 1980, is ready to open its Canadian house as soon as Ontario
security deregulation is implemented on June 30, Watanabe said,
adding Daiwa is very pleased with its reception by Canadian
regulatory authorities.
    Watanabe said about 10 pct of Japanese investment in
foreign securities goes to Canada, ranking second to the United
States which receives about 50 pct.
    ""The Japanese institutional investors feel that it is rather
risky to concentrate around the 50 pct"" in one country, he said.
    Japanese institutional investors are trying to diversify to
other non-American vehicles, and there are very few candidates
that remain safe investment objects, Daiwa's Watanabe added.
    Investors in Japan are also feeling it is risky to
concentrate in fixed income paper, and are looking more towards
investment in paper equity and real estate.
   ""So, investment in Canadian paper, especially Canadian
equity, should have a great future,"" Watanabe said.

"Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio
Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find
additional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil
reserves.
    ""We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,""
Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. ""In
the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested
in joint ventures.""
    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an
agreement with Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a
135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land
and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in
the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease
that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal
government undrilled because of low oil prices.
    ""At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with
Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,""
Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures
""would be best"" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in
the future.
    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to
acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. ""Retail sales
in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies,"" he
said.
    When asked whether he believed world oil prices might
strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to
hold steady at today's level.
    ""Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will
continue. But next year I don't know,"" he said. ""For the
refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is
18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care.""
    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require
modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. ""For exploration I
think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be
reasonable,"" he said.
    The key factor in determining whether the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a
barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and
Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain
element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain
revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced
oil profits.
    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is
benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors
continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency
regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.
    ""I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue
to improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in
dollars,"" he said.

"Mexico's policies for silver
production and sales have not changed despite Peru's decision
last week to freeze its silver sales, government mining and

    The officials also expressed doubt that such a policy
change was in the works.
    Mexico is the world's leading silver producer and had an
output of about 73.9 mln troy ounces last year, according to
preliminary government figures.
    Peru, the world's second leading silver producer, last week
suspended sales of the precious metal in what authorities in
Lima said was an effort to protect its price in an unstable
market.

"Bangladesh is keeping its options open on
whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the
United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,
but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the
cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.
    The official, who declined to be named, said the company
under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7
and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only
126,000 tonnes altogether.
    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs
per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed
by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he
told Reuters.
    ""If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,""
the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a
cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.
    A pro-government Bengali daily ""Dainik Janata"" reported today
that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka
(6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment
schedule.
    The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed
Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government
for an extension of the shipment period because loading of
wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a
faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet
granted the extension, he said.
    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone
up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial
loss to the company.
    He said he was not ""officially informed"" of the move to
impose a penalty, although he was ""not totally unaware of it.""

"China's oil drilling industry is one of
the few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about
1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100
expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleum
official said.
    ""In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,
and does not depend on the international price of oil,"" Zhai
Guang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,
told Reuters.
    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced at
about one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price established
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai said
in an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.
    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the United
States where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in the
number of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765
last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.
    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operation
than any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, another
member of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.
    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfield
equipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,
international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.
    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activity
is on land and under the control of the Chinese government
which requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.
    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment for
China's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate in
the actual drilling, he said.
    Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in
1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.
    ""We're encouraged,"" said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco's
foreign affairs, ""but we need substantial reserves before we
can do commercial production in a remote area like that.""
     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130
mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annually
by the year 2,000.
    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, with
ultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels.

"U.S. Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to
stimulate domestic oil and gas production.
    ""I am an advocate for incentives for exploration,"" Hodel
said, but added, ""I do not favor an oil import fee.""
    ""It would inject the federal government so deeply back in
to the process, we would never get the government out again,
and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the
nation,"" Hodel said in an address to a group of local business
executives.
    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing states
introduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.
    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repeal
of the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation
of natural gas.
    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore
California and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is
necessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent on
foreign supplies of oil for its energy needs.
    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would lead
to greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.
    ""In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,
we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more
dependent on imports for its oil requirements,"" Hodel said.
    If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would
likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices
and allocate supplies, Hodel said.
    ""If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same
two-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting
back in gas lines,"" Hodel said.
    Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize
environmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.
    ""We are convinced we can meet and resolve every
environmental concern that is raised,"" Hodel said.

"An oil import fee could cost
consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term
U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of 
domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.
    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a
five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports
would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a
year.
    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the
costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would
have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.
    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10
dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut
the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy
conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.
    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would
reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic
oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.
    ""Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting
imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by
speeding the depletion of domestic reserves,"" the study said.
    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic
petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,
increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13
billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 
8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.
    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently
opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state
and federal levels.
    ""This study backs up my belief that government regulation
and interference with competition hurt both the market and
consumers,"" FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement.

"Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, facing
an increasingly violent wave of labour unrest, has told
Spaniards he is determined to bring down inflation even if it
means slower growth and fewer votes for his Socialist Party.
    In a 50-minute television interview broadcast live,
Gonzalez criticized widespread protests which have blown up
less than a year after he won a resounding general election
victory.
    ""It seems so important to us that sometimes I ask myself
'Why don't they understand when I explain this?'"" Gonzalez said
of the anti-inflation strategy designed to modernise Spain and
make its economy competitive within the European Community.
    Gonzalez said the illegal work-to-rule at the airline was
grounding more and more planes and producing a backlog of
maintenance work which would not be cleared until the summer.
    ""The comfortable thing to do would be to give in and have no
problems,"" the 44-year-old prime minister said, adding that
nothing could justify the use of violence in a democracy.
    Gonzalez said he still believed it was possible to reduce
inflation to five pct this year from the current rate of 6.3
pct, even though other government officials have admitted the
target may now be beyond reach.

"The depressed offshore oil industry is
still waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisim
that world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     ""The perception of a turnaround comes from the change in
prices,"" Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of Marathon
Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp &lt;X>, and chairman of
the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a press
briefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.
     ""From the level of industry activity, there is no
turnaround,"" he added.
     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc
&lt;OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. ""We are through the low
part of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest for
projects,"" he said, adding, ""whether it comes to orders, who
knows?""
     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramatic
fall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under
10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the service
companies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such as
pipe and tools.
     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodel
announced -- at the Conference -- the government's new
five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38
sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore California
and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with the
plan, with most arguing that additional areas should have been
included. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.
     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had
lobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.
     ""The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to
take into account the environmental performance of the oil
industry,"" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of
Dresser Industries &lt;DI> and president of the Petroleum
Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing
offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution
in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and
municiple dumping 31 pct.
     ""The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve
development program,"" said Siess, adding that with oil imports
rising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of
national security.
     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of
Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, ""We are more likely
to see a five pct increase in spending this year than the
widely-forecast five pct decrease.""
     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New
Orleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised
290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.
     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and
Bates Drilling Co &lt;RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would
continue for the near-term, but added demand for
technologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.
     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into
icreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more
expensive and needing five to ten years to develop.
     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep
water tracts.
     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a
subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>, and president of the
Marine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill
exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.
     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the
Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of
companies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,
Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of
them testing new deep-water technologies involving floating
platforms.

"Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchi
approved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses ranging
from 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket of
basic consumer goods.
    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by
the cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchi
in a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees was
released this afternoon.
    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, saying
it will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986
and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.
    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.
    The wage increase for public and private sector employees
will be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. For
salaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for those
of 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.
    The measures were taken in response to a request from the
Venezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the loss
in the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated the
loss at 40 pct.
    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchi
since his government took office in February 1984.
    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be considered
in calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.
    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offs
and firings for the next 120 days.
    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and other
consumer goods declared to be ""of primary necessity.""
    It does not apply to prices charged by agricultural
producers or to goods for which the price is falling.
    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000
bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure.

    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain

cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.

"Plans for key reforms of the European
Community's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost
certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government
at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance minister
Mark Eyskens said today.
    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a
joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was
designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm
price package which has endured since March.
    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques
Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a
disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had
to be referred to heads of government.
    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and
vegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system by
which EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units
(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.
    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries
which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., A
major exporter of soybeans to the EC.
    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technical
currency move, which would result in additional price cuts for
farmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.
    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two
issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean
heads of government diverting their attention from much more
important world and Community issues.
    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also
likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest
themselves in such technically complex questions.
    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some
nuances in member state positions ""which may make the dialogue
more constructive in the next few weeks.""
    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,
the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct
cut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originally
proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this
year, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.
    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a
price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for
their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency
reforms.
    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need
for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC
budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.
    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's
meeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of a
major shift in the position of member states, or of finance
ministers adopting a different line from that of their
agriculture colleagues.
    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this
week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their
differences.

"Africa's efforts to revive its
economy are not being matched by international help, two of the
continent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference.
    Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou-
Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to act
over the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs,
at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA).
    Their view was backed by Monique Landry, Canada's Minister
for External Relations. ""Whether we look at aid or debt or
trade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their
part of last year's economic recovery pact.""
    Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to
spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing
particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so
unstable.
    Sassou Nguesso, current Chairman of the Organisation of
African Unity, accused international aid donors of failing to
provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.
    The conference, attended by African ministers, economists
and representatives from major donors, will review progress
since both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive the
African economy over five years.
    The response from the international community has been
negative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa
already look far too optimistic, ECA Executive Secretary
Adebayo Adedeji told the conference.
    Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts of
Africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment
and grace terms to be eased.
    They won a degree of support from Landry, ""Even private
bankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term
solutions to Africa's debt.""

"The world's zinc mining and smelting
industry will continue to become more concentrated and more
integrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president of
marketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said.
    Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,
Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in the
industry would continue to decline as companies merged or
formed conglomerates with increased market shares.
    At the same time, the conglomerates would become more
integrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore production
through marketing, he added.
    ""The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices are
likely to remain at current historically low levels at least in
the medium term, and competition with other metals and
materials will continue to intensify,"" Goekmann said.
    ""In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world's
market and economics. In the future, we have to act less
defensively and more aggressively.""
    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problem
has to be tackled quickly, he added.
    ""Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity in
Europe have all failed miserably. However, there is some hope
that current efforts may be successful,"" Goekmann said.
    At the same time, companies must move to limit their
geographical and currency risks and become far more marketing
orientated, he added.
    ""With all these changes and rationalization, the industry
can survive to recover its past strength and profitability.
Without them, the future does not look very rosy,"" Goekmann
said.

"The Basin Pipeline in the Southwestern
U.S. reopened yesterday with the expectation that all crude oil
shipments for June will arrive on schedule, according to a
spokesman for Texaco Inc. &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline
through its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.
    ""We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipments
scheduled,"" said Dan Stevens, the spokesman. 
    The pipeline reopened Sunday evening around 1900 EDT,
carrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per day
compared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 days
before its shutdown on May 30, according to Stevens.
    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for all
crude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via the
pipeline by the end of June.
    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupture
caused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahoma
border. It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising
waters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the
reopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inch
steel piping was installed under the river to replace damaged
piping, according to Stevens.

"Lack of rainfall in recent weeks may
have affected Ivory Coast 1987/88 main crop cocoa prospects,
although good precipitation in the last half of June and in
July could still reverse the situation, trade sources said.
    They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and
it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell
on the harvest.
    ""This year's crop will probably be another good one. It is
impossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should be
no problems unless something drastic happens,"" one trader said.
    Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that most
Ivory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the
weekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday.
    ""Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quite
dry, except along the western portion of the coast,"" it said.
    Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dry
conditions had not affected the entire country.
    The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for
comment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfall
in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,
although it is difficult to assess what the minimum
requirements are.
    Trade sources said there had been good rains in late
January, February and March which helped to promote flowering,
but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the
south west of the country.
    The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered by
March/April rains but the main crop, still in its formation
period, depends largely on rainfall from April through July.
    The main rains normally last between May and July, before
returning again in September/October. ""Flowering has been less
than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the
moment, then they have a chance to recover,"" one trader said.
    Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of
time to develop and the rains were ""not good but still not bad.""
    The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a
cause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa were
presently taking a back seat to other factors in the
international cocoa market.
    This is not only because of the premature nature of any
harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa
already burdening the market, they said.
    ""With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the
buffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,
the weather has not been a factor,"" one private consultant said.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoa
market report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likely
to total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86
crop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.

"Roy Denman, the European Community
representative in Washington, warned the United States against
setting a rule that trading partners running a surplus should
be ""beaten over the head"" for not removing trade barriers.
    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, said
trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,
either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-based
United Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
GATT.
    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate
this week on a major trade bill.
    ""It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners
running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over
the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are
not removed within a certain time-scale,"" said Denman in an
apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional
trade bill.
    ""If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliation
and counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading system
will very quickly unravel,"" he said.
    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not
purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.
    ""The trade deficit results from a combination of
macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchange
rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,""
Denman said.
    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair
trade prctices.
    He said the European Community had recently updated a list
of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.

aggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight,"" Denman

"Bonn is expected to rush through
legislation this month creating special credits to protect West
German farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments
freeze, government sources said.
    The new measures are apparently designed to shield West
German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget
crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC
executive commission's farm policy reform plans, political
sources said.
    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint
session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over
future farm financing.
    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission
attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing
imports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.
retaliation.
    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary
mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.
    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right
coalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide
temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.
    The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency
Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the
year, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some
subsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states
take urgent measures to provide fresh funds.
    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new
legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to
a farm price package for 1986/87.
    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the
sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies
by creating a buffer for West German farmers.
    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and
allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of
the summer recess, SPD sources said.
    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party
would support the bill, even though it would further swell
massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill
was an admission that the government believes the farm price
talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.
    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,
government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1
billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and
premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.
    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.
But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks
(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.
    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the
bill when it meets tomorrow.

"Treasury Secretary James

currencies would be counterproductive.

Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could
see some further decline in the dollar within reason.

    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White
House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that
the United States wants a stable dollar.
    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker
dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,

"The West German Government will be asked
June 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 million
dollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobs
are threatened by the recent slump in the country's steel
industry.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.
    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tell
Kohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough to
protect German steel firms from subsidies and unfair
competition from other European Community members.
    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in a
common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts by
slashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up the
whole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.
    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,
said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workers
in Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would be
redeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,
while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retraining
schemes.
    The union estimates that the redundancy payments would
total 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while job
retraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130
million dollars).
    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the next
few years following steep losses incurred by the industry since
mid-1986.
    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years was
unable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar which
depressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said.

"The U.S. corn and soybean crops are

Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. ""The (corn
and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is
progressing ahead of normal, which is good,"" he said.
    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas
sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new

per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.
    ""This rally is amazing,"" a private crop analyst said. ""Corn,
soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition.""
    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,
dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up
development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope
with stress later in its more critical growing period.
    ""What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards
rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the
subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through
a little stress early on,"" Strommen said.

soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July
and August.
    But because of its early development this year, Strommen
said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction
period by the first of July.
    ""Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or
soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the
dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,"" an
analyst said.
    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more
weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop
analysts agreed.
    August and September are the critical yield-producing
months for soybeans, Strommen said.
    ""The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive
during May, June and July until the August rains which
determine the crop,"" a crop analyst said.
    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing
areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure
that there will not be problems later.
    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather
forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal
precipitation in much of the corn belt.
    ""This opens up all sorts of speculation,"" he said.

"Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with
more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the
30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for
delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set
life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a
bushel.
    ""The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than
normal for some time out,"" said David Bartholomew, assistant
vice president for Merrill Lynch. ""We have probably gone as
high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to
measure the euphoria level.""
    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,
posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit
in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.
    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,
with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4
dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved
harvest conditions in the southern Midwest.
    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean
plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit
young plants by encouraging the development of deep root
systems, Bartholomew said.
    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to
active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean
orders went unfilled at the close, traders said.
    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not
suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.
    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the
dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more
expensive for foreign buyers.
    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's
COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle
steady.
    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the
weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of
inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,
which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.
trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.
    A USDA report released after trading said the number of
cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above
levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would
probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52
mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade
forecasts.
    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,
up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off
93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.
    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot
weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.

"The glitter of gold has generated a
three-way competition among the world's largest futures
exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.
    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces
gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go
toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange
Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe
as the world's precious metals futures capital for
institutional business.
    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending
application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side
with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)
gold futures.
    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in
1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument
in July 1986.
    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the
exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent
volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the
decision may also have been clearing problems in May which
forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in
an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,
especially in silver futures.
    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for
other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals
contracts, industry sources say.
    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges
can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume
of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to
buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.
    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold
contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,
was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has
surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.
    ""The climate could not be better for this venture by the
CME,"" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil
McGarrity.
    ""Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting
daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.
There's good trading volume in all world outlets,"" McGarrity
added.
    ""The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,
merchants and customers that there would be a market open for
trading,"" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the
Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice
president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.
Inc. and a Comex board member.
    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold
futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York
warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery
through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member
of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies
delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.
    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an
earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting
time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start
allows for trading before many important government reports are
released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.
    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist
with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be
generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term
debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge
their financial risks.
    ""If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy
gold,"" said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.
    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold
trading. ""Given our night trading session, we could add either
our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver
contract to attract overseas business,"" a CBT official said.
    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital
does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.
    ""We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with
perhaps different needs,"" Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry
Jarecki said.
    ""Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid
contract. Our firm is no exception,"" Jarecki said.
    ""At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will
be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing
processes,"" a CME official added.

"The European Community (EC) executive
Commission will today urgently consider whether to take a new
initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the
bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.
    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what
diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint
meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in
Luxembourg Monday.
    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present
farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for
1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were
first announced in March.
    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a
plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance
rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures
which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted
into member state currencies.
    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans
fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax
plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a
chance of agreement on other aspects of the package.
      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to
farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.
      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would
include plans for revising the current oils and fats and
currency regulations.
     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in
meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues
could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at
the end of the month.
    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure
the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means
of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be
""disastrous"" if farm issues had to be discussed by government
leaders.
    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75
billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,
the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the
traditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said
    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired
yesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some
aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to
be referred to the summit.
    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as
useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed
to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.
    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have
lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and
fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.

"The growing shift of low-skilled
manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border
cities is not a threat to American employment because it will
help create new markets for products, according to a study
released today.
    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of
Arizona, which studies international trade issues, said the
United States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing
in developing countries so that those nations can become
consumers of more U.S. goods.
    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,
Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission
which is gathering information for a report to Congress on what
changes may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the
loss of jobs and industry.
    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from
a trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ
factory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.
    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient
tax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into
Mexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that
are completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.
    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in
low-paying jobs across the border reflected changing
demographics of the U.S. workforce.
    ""In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available
to fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be
better educated than prior generations,"" Bolin told reporters in
McAllen.
    ""The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to
other countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be
able to fill in the future.""
    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged
by more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the
transfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American
employment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during
the same period, he said.
    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make up
more than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages and
generate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said.

"The dollar should worth more than 170 yen
based on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on
international trade.
    Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation
differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth
quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.
    MITI also said the so-called ""J-curve"" and the drop in oil
prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6
billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.
    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose
to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.
    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5
billion dlrs and the ""J-curve"" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in
the 1986 surplus.
    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in
recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be
accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in
economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36
pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.
    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982
to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange
rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of
imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic
growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other
minor factors have been left out.
    ""One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of
exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to
experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally
predisposed to growth in exports,"" MITI said.
    Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under
the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are
stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.
    Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry
cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor
in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe,
replacing design and brand reputations.
    ""The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for
measures to address the needs of affected firms,"" it said. ""Whole
industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to
suffer.""
    ""Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will
also be an essential condition,"" the ministry said.
    It said four structural factors have contributed to the
growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline
in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive
capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies
and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.
    ""While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the
dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in
the import picture,"" MITI said.

"Treasurer Paul Keating said he now
expected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal
1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.
    In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figures
showed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,
Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about
1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billion
issued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.
    However, the government had subsequently revised the
forecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of current
account figures indicated a declining trend.
    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecast
compares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in
1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficit
recorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.
    Keating said the main reason for his revision was a
better-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterly
figures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to
March 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.
    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit
for the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion

"Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supply
Taiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total
70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the joint
committee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters.
    He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayans
reluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56
U.S. Dlrs per tonne.
    The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment after
the Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order,
but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June
5-25, the committee spokesman said.
    Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayan
grain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices on
the soybeans but said the government would not intervene in the
dispute.
    ""The deal was agreed to between two private companies,
without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayan
government,"" Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman Andres
Bonino said.
    He added, ""Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes of
soybeans, since total production this year has been lower than
that figure.""
    The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the
70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.
    Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, told
reporters, ""Both countries are finishing details to arrive at a
satisfactory price.""
    He said the price would be ""very advantageous (for Uruguay)
because it will be above the international price.""
    Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year,
making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.
    Taiwan's joint committee holds a tender today for two
shipments of U.S. Soybeans totalling 87,000 tonnes.

"The Venice summit accord gives the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in
smoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial
countries, a senior IMF official said.
    The official, who met reporters but asked not to be
identified, made clear that the use of a series of economic
measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial
democracies would be difficult but was a major step in
cooperation.
    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of
economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an
attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.
    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a
step forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised
because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic
behaviour that hurt other countries.
    But the official said influences and peer pressure could
have a major impact in reforming an erring country.
    Economists generally believe a cooperative economic
approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact
on the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor
countries.
    The official said the IMF function would be to warn
countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and
try to persuade them to modify it. ""I hope it will be a yellow
light, not a red flag,"" he said.
    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next
few weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,
which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.
    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currently
financed at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripled
under the plan.
    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very
difficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and
finding reasons to reduce their own exposure. ""They will be
tremendously difficult negotiations,"" he said.

a real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly

    The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.
    For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct,
after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performance
was the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,

"OPEC has regained its former role as
price-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,
acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.
    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for
OPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continued
sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.
    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, said
the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per
barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the
producers' group was serious.
    ""It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this
has restored its credibility,"" said al-Chalabi, who is in
Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.
    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the
production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot
market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.
    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic
dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said.
""The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price and
risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and
let the price drop?"" he asked.
    ""OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is
how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?"" 
he said.
    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up
prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no
quick end to restraint in production.
    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil
because increased non-OPEC production, combined with
conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has
caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

    Analysts said the results from Sunday's and Monday's voting
should boost the bourse in the short-term, but the market's
medium-term prospects remain clouded because of doubt over how
long it will take to form a new government.
    ""The result is positive in the sense that the Communists
suffered a defeat and Italians voted for stability,"" director
Paolo Azzoni at Milan investment bank &lt;ABK Spa>, told Reuters.
    Uncertainty about the election outcome and the possibility
of large Communist gains has been weighing on the bourse in the
last two weeks, brokers said.
    Final returns show the Socialists, led by former Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi, increasing their vote to 14.3 pct from
11.4 in 1983, while the Communists dropped more than three
points to 26.6 pct.
    Support for the Christian Democrats rose to 34.3 pct from
an all-time low of 32.9 in 1983.
    Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing C. Olivetti EC Spa
&lt;OLIV.MI>, commenting on the results last night on Italian
television, said ""I am sure the reaction of international
markets will be extremely favourable to the electoral verdict.""
    Broker Francesco Dinepi at Milan investment firm &lt;Sige
Spa>, said some U.K. Institutional investors had placed buy
orders in Milan this morning.
    ""In the medium-term, the direction of the market depends on
the Christian Democrats and Socialists resolving their
differences,"" said Dinepi.
     ""What Italy wants is another government and quickly,"" added
Azzoni.

"The Bundesbank could announce today
that it will lift its veto on the private holding of European
Currency Unit (ECU) liabilities, banking sources said.
    But this would probably be the only significant news from
today's council session, brought forward from its usual

    The sources said Bundesbank officials had been working out
technical and legal problems with the ECU since the subject was

Stoltenberg on May 7.
    With the primary internal work on the ECU completed,
approval from the 18-member central bank council was now
virtually a mere formality, the sources said.
    Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, chairing today's

likely to be lifted, allowing individuals to open ECU accounts
and incur liabilities previously mainly executed through the

"Government officials said the worst may be
over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger
than expected growth in the January/March period.
    But private economists were not so sure and said the
economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth
forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.
    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March
quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three
months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP
growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.
    The government economists acknowledged that the improved
export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to
be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two
pct from the previous three months.
    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150
probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June
quarter, they said.
    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up
domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the
economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.
    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy
will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the
1987/88 year.
    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's
forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last
December from an original four pct.
    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for
housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi
Research Institute.
    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in
nominal income stays low, he added.
     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter
was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the
preceding three months, Takahashi said.
    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but
this was primarily because utility companies brought forward
their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter
of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation
package announced last fall, he said.
    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he
was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he
expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.
    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting
to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.
    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower
interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the
sector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000
billion yen economic package will also help the economy.
    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the
government's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth
might come close to three pct.

"The West German government today considered
demands for nearly 850 mln marks to lay off or retrain 20,000
steel workers.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a special meeting with steel industry
representatives.
    Companies like Fried Krupp &lt;KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG
&lt;HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken the
unusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IG
Metall, to press for government finance to slim staff levels
still further.
    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part in
a common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the government was struggling to finance tax cuts by
reducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.
    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresaw
redundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland
plants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel
making sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would
be eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies are
estimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost a
further 240 mln.

"Next year is likely to see a shortfall
in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there
should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd
metals analyst Stephen Briggs said.
    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals
conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted
100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was
the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling
at Pine Point in Canada.
    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.
    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was
unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in
1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of
record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated
in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity
in South Korea.
    ""Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also
expected in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels
at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with
achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro
in Canada.
    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable
opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity
of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.
    ""Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there
will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,"" he
added.
    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of
zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore
supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from
zinc mines.
    ""On this basis, our calculations point to a modest
oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    The copper forecast, however, was for a record
non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,
increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.
    Production of primary refined copper metal would also
increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to
a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes
this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the
decade, he said.

"Indonesia will try to increase sugar
output in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2
mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.
    He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gains
will come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes per
hectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes.
    He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States to
become the world's fourth largest producer compared with its
current seventh position.
    Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia's
self-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequate
stocks.
    Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but the
U.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was
1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.
    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last year
and in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.
    The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar cane
farms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumption

"Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm
markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of
farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato said.
    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism
of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.
    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade
talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.
    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme
example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.
Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports
except in emergency.
    Kato said Japanese farmers should however ""shed some blood,""
to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.
    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice
Price Council at which the government advisory body will
discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.
    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent
summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in
Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.
    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need
to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.
    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect
producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion
dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export
enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends
only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the
world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per
farm family was several times lower than in the United States.
    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in
U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent
farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a
factor increasing protectionism in the United States.
    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions
at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's
import restrictions on 12 farm items.

"Parliament approved a proposal to drop
all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that
Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the
world economy.
    A government spokesman said the new law would be
promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and
financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls
on currency outflows at any time.
    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year
will remain in place, the spokesman said.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls
will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.
    The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting
currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have
led to runaway growth in money supply.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade
surplus and the government fears they are making the island a
target for U.S. Trade protectionism.
    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it
was with the United States.
    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the
year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    Local bankers and economists say when the controls are
lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and
invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations
of a sudden outflow of capital.
    ""I don't think we're going to see a big bang,"" John Brinsden,
the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a
recent interview.
    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast
quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also
have been freely buying and exporting currency through a
flourishing black-market.
    ""Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't
think it's going to be much,"" said Danny Chan, director of
Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.
    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital
outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of
the local currency.
    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the
U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of
speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at
31.08.
    The government spokesman said the new law does not empower
authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any
proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of
parliament.
    Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted
it will be almost impossible to reimpose them.

"There should be at least one merger
between major European zinc smelters before the end of the
decade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) of
SMM Penarroya in France, said.
    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base
metals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks
between five smelters including Penarroya to result in
integration between at least some of the companies before 1990.
    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag
Ag, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,
have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.
    ""We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses
into large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat
price competition and the trend to forward integration from the
mining companies,"" Bue said.
    ""It is by no means certain that all the five companies
involved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite
likely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form
two or three large integrated blocs.
    ""In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our
concentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on
the other,"" Bue added.
    In the past, production overcapacity and the intense
competition between the European zinc smelters has meant they
have not only been in a very weak negotiating position when
buying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the
metal, Bue noted.
    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut
down excess capacity, the burden of this on individual
companies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to
volunteer, he added.
    Another possible but very risky solution is to invest
heavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.
    ""My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies
who do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest
might survive, but only might, "" Bue said.
    ""The only real option in my mind is integration,
rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, "" he
added.
    Bue also said that the European smelters were completely
dissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and
metals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket
of the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency
units (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.
    Bue's views on integration between European smelters were
met by general approval from the conference audience comprising
representatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting
and trading companies, although some of the mining
representatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own
industry's move towards integration with smelters.
    However, some concentrate traders did express worry about
their own position if the metals industry does make the move to
large trading blocs.
    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but
few said they thought matters would change in the near future.

"The EC Commission has proposed a
modified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats
in its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals, an official
document detailing the proposals shows.
    The document, made available to journalists, says the
commission proposes that the tax should start at levels
originally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1.
    However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50
pct from originally envisaged levels, the document said.
    In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of the
tax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewed
every three months rather than annually.
    Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for
fish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to
the tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations.
    Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, West
Germany and Denmark.
    The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original
plans in other sectors.
    However, they mark the Commission's recognition that it
cannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for
cereals, diplomats said.
    Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly
increments applied to cereals during the November to May period
when intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat
and two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.
    The document shows the Commission has also changed its
green currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,
notably from West Germany.
    West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatory
amounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with a
further one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season.
    The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantling
of positive MCAs.
     For other countries, the Commission makes the following
proposals for dismantling negative MCAs
     Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points for
animal products and just over two points for crops.
     France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for an
extra 1.5 point cut for beef.
     Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created since
January 12.
    Britain - five point cut for most products, 6.5 points for
beef.
    Greece, Spain and Portugal - for most products, dismantling
of seven, 14 and 5.5 points respectively.
