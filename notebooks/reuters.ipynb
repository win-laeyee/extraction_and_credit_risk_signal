It has followed Wall Street and other\\n  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\\n  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\\n  equities, particularly in the gold sector.\\n      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\\n  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\\n  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\\n  same period.\\n      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\\n  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in\\n  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real\\n  estate, particularly in the tourism field.\\n      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\\'s five-star\\n  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\\n  as indicative of the type of property being sought.\\n      \"They think they find good value real estate here which,\\n  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\\n  investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\\n  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to\\n  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\\n      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\\n  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\\n  protectionism and control on capital movements.\\n      \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\\n  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\\n  them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\\n  determined market trends.\\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\\n  rise faster than GNP.\\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\\n  investment in the U.S.\\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.',\n",

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\\n      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\\n  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\\n  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\\n      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\\n  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\\n  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\\n  possibly to 140 yen.\\n      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann\\'s view, saying he expects\\n  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\\n      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\\n  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\\n  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\\n  operators to test the downside.\\n      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\\n  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\\n  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\\n  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\\n  long term, the traders said.\\n      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\\n  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar\\'s\\n  downward trend.\\n      Traders in several centres said the market would look for\\n  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\\n  defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\\n  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\\n  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\\n      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\\n  \"They\\'re going to put somebody\\'s resolve to the test soon.\" The\\n  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\\n      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\\n  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\\n  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\\n  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\\n      Chase Bank\\'s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\\n  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\\n  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\\n  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.\\n      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\\n  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a\\n  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\\n      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\\n  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\\n  accord\\'s supposed currency target range.\\n      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\\n  ready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\\n      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\\n  contributing to greater stability.\\n      \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\\n  boost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\\n  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\\n  in the next three months.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Today\\'s turmoil in the U.S. Financial\\n  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar\\'s\\n  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that\\n  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.\\n      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar\\'s decline\\n  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell\\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\\'s\\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\\n      \"Volcker\\'s been saying for a long time that a dollar\\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\\'s got it,\" said\\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\\n  worries that the dollar\\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scare\\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\\n  by 33 points to 2339.\\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\\n  markets\\' instability frightening. He believes economic\\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\\n  you start the ball rolling it\\'s difficult to stop.\"\\n      \"There\\'s a stark possibility that you could get a\\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\\n      \"We\\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\\n      The stock market\\'s reaction today and its sharp drop on\\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\\'s latest\\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\\n  massive budget deficit.\\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston\\'s Jones.\\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It\\'s ridiculous to think the Federal\\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\\n  weakness,\" he said.\\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\\n      \"We\\'re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\\n  will have been greater.\\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.',\n",

With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\\n      \"The Fed\\'s actions on Friday and today show that it is\\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\\n  said Jones of Lanston.\\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\\n  overtly at some point.\"\\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\\n  further aid the dollar.\\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\\'s end.\\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.',\n",

It was Schmidt who, as\\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\\n      In recent months, with the mark\\'s strong rise against the\\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\\n  the Bundesbank\\'s council, a highly conservative institution\\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\\n  of galloping inflation this century.\\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\\n  Poehl\\'s reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\\n      \"Poehl\\'s policy has always been a policy which does not\\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\\n  economy,\" she said.\\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\\n      One of Poehl\\'s great struggles recently has been to\\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\\n  currencies.\\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\\n  don\\'t know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\\n  round, making a speculator\\'s position worthless.\\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\\n  play golf.\\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said.

That would not\\n  represent a tightening of policy, however.\\n      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\\n  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\\n  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\\n      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\\n  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\\n  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\\n      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\\n  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\\n  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French\\n  occupation this century.\\n      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\\n  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\\n  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\\n  treated for minimum reserve purposes.',\n",

It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\\n      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\\n  reacted to Baker\\'s criticism of rising West German interest\\n  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide.

They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\\n  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\\n  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\\n  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\\n      German yields have also risen over this period, but less\\n  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\\n  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security\\n  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\\n  money market.\\n      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\\n  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany\\'s\\n  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\\n  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\\n  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\\n  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\\n  bank economists said.\\n      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\\n  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\\n  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\\n  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\\n      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\\n  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\\n  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\\n  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\\n      \"They (the Bundesbank) just don\\'t want to come too much\\n  under American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\\n  Swiss Bank Corp here.\\n      \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\\n  significant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\\n  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\\n      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\\n  the Bundesbank\\'s next tender for a securities repurchase pact\\n  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\\n  economists said.\\n      Today\\'s injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\\n  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\\n  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\\n  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\\n      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\\n  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance\\n  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\\n      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\\n  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\\n  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\\n  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.\\n      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\\n  Germany for Sweden on Monday.

It recommended that to stop friction\\n  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\\n  transformation in its traditional policies on economic\\n  management and the nation\\'s lifestyle. There can be no further\\n  development for Japan without this transformation.\"\\n      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\\n  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\\n  Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\\n  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\\n      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\\n  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\\n  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\\n  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\\n  semiconductor pact.\\n      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\\n  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\\n  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\\n  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\\n  telecommunications joint venture.\\n      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\\n  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\\n  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\\n      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\\n  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\\n  views last November when he visited the European Community.\\n  \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\\n  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\\n  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\\n  results of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\\n      \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\\n  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\\n  domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\\n      Saito\\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\\n  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\\n  only know that your government, under the leadership of\\n  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\\n  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\\n  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\\n      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\\n  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the\\n  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\\n  we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\\n  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\\n      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\\n  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\\'s report as a sea of\\n  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\\n      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\\n  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\\n  problem.\\n      \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\\n  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\\n  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\\n      \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\\n  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\\n  labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers.\\n      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\\n      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\\n  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\\n  the country asking about this issue.\\n      He said People mentioned many things in line with the\\n  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\\n  steel industries.\\n      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\\n  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,\\n  underlined by von Moltke\\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the\\n  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\\n  September\\'s government programme of new economic measures.\\n  \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\\n  that the government has put its signature to a programme\\n  designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.',\n",
