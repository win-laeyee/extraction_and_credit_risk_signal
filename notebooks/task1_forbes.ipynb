Biden was interviewed on NBC Nightly News by Lester Holt. (Photo by Demetrius Freeman/The Washington ... [+] Post via Getty Images) Holt asked if Biden has a “sense of wanting to get back on the horse” following his debate performance last month, to which Biden replied, “I’m on the horse. Where have you been?” Biden cited major events he has attended in the last few weeks, saying he’s met thousands of people and spoken to “overwhelming crowds” in what he called demonstrations to the American people that he has control of his mental faculties, which have come under scrutiny following the debate and two events last week. Biden was asked if he watched the debate and said he watched parts of it before asking Holt why the press has not talked about “the 18—28 lies [Trump] told,” though several fact-checking stories were published by multiple major outlets during and after the debate. The president said he agreed to debate Trump in September, adding he does not plan on having a similar performance to the first debate, which he characterized as a “bad, bad night” for him before saying he “wasn’t feeling well at all.” Biden urged Holt “come and talk to me about what we should be talking about,” as the two concluded the interview.

Biden’s interview aligned with recent comments he has made maintaining he will see his presidential run through until the end, which materialized as several Democrats in Congress called for him to drop out. The president is trailing Trump by 2.7 points on average in a national head-to-head race, according to RealClearPolitics’ poll tracker. Biden told Holt the race between Trump and him is “essentially a toss-up race,” saying the “polling data shows a lot of different things” before touting his achievements as president and noting “the job’s not finished.” Full Interview: President Joe Biden interviewed by Lester Holt (NBC News) Biden Vs.

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Grandma.', 'date': 'Jun 30, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Chloe Sorvino', 'content': \"From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan’s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan’s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that’s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. “I wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,” says Gill, “One that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.” The mass appeal of Bachan’s is one of many reasons why Gill’s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan’s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan’s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan’s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan’s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan’s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce—in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. “I bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,” Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan’s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is “totally self-sustainable.” “At a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,” says Gill. “But A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.” Gill’s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill’s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill’s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family’s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother’s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. “I wanted to do something I love,” Gill recalls, “and really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.” It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. “I really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we’d have something totally different,” says Gill. “And if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.” The 10 ingredients Bachan’s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality—certainly more premium than what Gill’s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan’s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan’s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year—from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan’s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” says Damon Keith, Walmart’s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan’s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends—one for $100,000 was tied to his home—but he couldn’t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan’s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan’s—to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the “ethnic” aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there’s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan’s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan’s became the top seller in the grocer’s barbecue sauce aisle. “It can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It’s really regionally driven,” says Whole Foods’ Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. “What's exciting about Bachan’s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce—but in a totally different way.” In 2021, Gill raised Bachan’s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon’s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. “It was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,” says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude’s managing partner and cofounder. “But it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.” It was Gill’s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan’s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan’s, which Sonoma’s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been “just mind-blowing to me as an investor.” “It's a Sriracha 2.0,” Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. “Sriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan’s in the same way.” That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America’s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan’s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan’s even got mentioned by Walmart’s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan’s as an example of how he’s “personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.” Bachan’s has “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” adds Damon Keith, Walmart’s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan’s has “performed very well and grown share.” After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan’s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he’s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and “going deeper” in the category. As awareness of Bachan’s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. “We want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,” says Gill. “I want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.”\"}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). “It’s an honor,” said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. “It’s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that’s all behind us know and we’re just going to move forward.” — Alexander on coming back from his suspension • No. 30 — RB AJ Dillon • No. 29 — LB Isaiah McDuffie • No. 28 — CB Carrington Valentine • No. 27 — TE Tucker Kraft • No. 26 — LB Edgerrin Cooper • No. 25 — DE Lukas Van Ness • No. 24 — Keisean Nixon • No. 23 — WR Dontayvion Wicks • No. 22 — OL Jordan Morgan • No. 21 — DL T.J.

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump’s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump’s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump’s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he’s hoping he’ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he’d be “disappointed” if he wasn’t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he’s not Trump’s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn’t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum—a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he’s worth about $100 million)—“great,” but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is “an issue.” Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

(Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.\"}\n",
      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/06/26/future-of-tv-business-television-showrunners-bear-season-three-christopher-storer/', 'title': 'Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television', 'date': 'Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Matt Craig', 'content': 'It wasn’t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer’s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be—an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. “The national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,” the account Awful Announcing penned on X. “It is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,” added another X user. “I’m so sorry, I’m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I’ve ever heard in my whole life,” wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie’s infamous live version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. “With all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was not good. I’m sorry, but it wasn’t. We’re all thinking it and it has to be said,” wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

[+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

[+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important.

Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/06/28/airline-miles-hotel-points-hacking/', 'title': 'Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points', 'date': 'Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT', 'author': 'Jeremy Bogaisky', 'content': \"Most people don’t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them.

This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg\\'s two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he\\'s allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.'}\n",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told “The Download” podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release “Vultures 2” on May 3—nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album’s alleged release—West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted “Vultures 2 en route” on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West’s fans on social media are anticipating the album won’t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song “Talking,” a cut from “Vultures 1,” and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar—but neither seem to have anything to do with “Vultures 2.” West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for “Vultures 1,” his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn’t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his “Vultures” trilogy would release March 8 and April 5—but he’s since missed both of these deadlines. “Vultures 1” was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer’s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, “I Feel Love,” after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. “Vultures 1” was West’s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put “Vultures 2” on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming “devalues music.” According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How “Vultures 2” will fare on the charts. “Vultures 1” previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single “Carnival” went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100—but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold “Vultures 2” from streaming services, the album’s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, “Vultures 2” would face chart competition from Dua Lipa’s “Radical Optimism,” also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of “The Tortured Poets Department,” the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University’s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University’s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported. May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported—10 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school’s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University’s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated “40 to 50” who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). “It’s an honor,” said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. “It’s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity.

Nikki Haley, but has so far refrained from donating to Trump’s 2024 campaign. In May, he said he was waiting to see who Trump chooses to run as his vice presidential running mate before deciding whether to donate (Trump on Monday announced Sen. J.D.

Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump’s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world\\'s richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.'}\n",

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump.” Biden-Trump Debates: What To Know As CNN Reveals Moderators For Next Month’s Faceoff (Forbes) Biden Vs.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks’ phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was “motivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.” What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As ‘Comically Bad Shot’: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)\"}\n",

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/06/26/future-of-tv-business-television-showrunners-bear-season-three-christopher-storer/', 'title': 'Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television', 'date': 'Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Matt Craig', 'content': 'It wasn’t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer’s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be—an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. “The national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,” the account Awful Announcing penned on X. “It is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,” added another X user. “I’m so sorry, I’m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I’ve ever heard in my whole life,” wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie’s infamous live version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. “With all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was not good. I’m sorry, but it wasn’t. We’re all thinking it and it has to be said,” wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

(Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.” “She didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,” said Park. “She is just amazing with her punches.” When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, “This is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.” The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.\"}\n",

Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO’s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I’d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don’t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She’s noble and kind for the most part. But she’s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard’s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father’s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King’s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark’s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they’re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that’s really missing—the thing that you can’t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you’re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones—is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I’m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he’s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren’t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters—Tyrion perhaps most of all—are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we’ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There’s always a smirk on Aemond’s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon’s eyes, but you’ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what’s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven’t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn’t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are “about as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.” If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.”'}\n",

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices.

Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/06/28/airline-miles-hotel-points-hacking/', 'title': 'Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points', 'date': 'Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT', 'author': 'Jeremy Bogaisky', 'content': \"Most people don’t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg\\'s two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he\\'s allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.'}\n",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told “The Download” podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release “Vultures 2” on May 3—nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album’s alleged release—West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted “Vultures 2 en route” on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West’s fans on social media are anticipating the album won’t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song “Talking,” a cut from “Vultures 1,” and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar—but neither seem to have anything to do with “Vultures 2.” West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for “Vultures 1,” his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn’t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his “Vultures” trilogy would release March 8 and April 5—but he’s since missed both of these deadlines. “Vultures 1” was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer’s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, “I Feel Love,” after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. “Vultures 1” was West’s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put “Vultures 2” on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming “devalues music.” According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How “Vultures 2” will fare on the charts. “Vultures 1” previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single “Carnival” went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100—but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold “Vultures 2” from streaming services, the album’s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, “Vultures 2” would face chart competition from Dua Lipa’s “Radical Optimism,” also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of “The Tortured Poets Department,” the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University’s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University’s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest.

May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University’s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated “40 to 50” who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Grandma.', 'date': 'Jun 30, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Chloe Sorvino', 'content': \"From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan’s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan’s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that’s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. “I wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,” says Gill, “One that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.” The mass appeal of Bachan’s is one of many reasons why Gill’s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan’s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan’s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan’s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan’s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan’s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce—in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. “I bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,” Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan’s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is “totally self-sustainable.” “At a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,” says Gill. “But A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.” Gill’s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill’s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill’s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family’s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother’s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. “I wanted to do something I love,” Gill recalls, “and really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.” It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. “I really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we’d have something totally different,” says Gill. “And if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.” The 10 ingredients Bachan’s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality—certainly more premium than what Gill’s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan’s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan’s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year—from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan’s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” says Damon Keith, Walmart’s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan’s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends—one for $100,000 was tied to his home—but he couldn’t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan’s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan’s—to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the “ethnic” aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there’s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan’s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan’s became the top seller in the grocer’s barbecue sauce aisle. “It can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It’s really regionally driven,” says Whole Foods’ Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. “What's exciting about Bachan’s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce—but in a totally different way.” In 2021, Gill raised Bachan’s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon’s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. “It was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,” says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude’s managing partner and cofounder. “But it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.” It was Gill’s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan’s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan’s, which Sonoma’s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been “just mind-blowing to me as an investor.” “It's a Sriracha 2.0,” Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. “Sriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan’s in the same way.” That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America’s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan’s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan’s even got mentioned by Walmart’s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan’s as an example of how he’s “personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.” Bachan’s has “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” adds Damon Keith, Walmart’s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan’s has “performed very well and grown share.” After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan’s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he’s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and “going deeper” in the category. As awareness of Bachan’s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. “We want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,” says Gill. “I want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.”\"}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). “It’s an honor,” said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. “It’s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that’s all behind us know and we’re just going to move forward.” — Alexander on coming back from his suspension • No. 30 — RB AJ Dillon • No. 29 — LB Isaiah McDuffie • No. 28 — CB Carrington Valentine • No. 27 — TE Tucker Kraft • No. 26 — LB Edgerrin Cooper • No. 25 — DE Lukas Van Ness • No. 24 — Keisean Nixon • No. 23 — WR Dontayvion Wicks • No. 22 — OL Jordan Morgan • No. 21 — DL T.J.

In additional to his hedge fund, he founded Citadel Securities in 2002, which has since become one of the largest market-making firms in the world, responsible for one of every five stock trades in the U.S. He has donated more than $2 billion to philanthropic causes, and the graduate school of arts and sciences at Harvard, his alma mater, bears his name. Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump’s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world\\'s richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.'}\n",

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump’s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump’s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump’s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he’s hoping he’ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he’d be “disappointed” if he wasn’t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he’s not Trump’s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn’t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum—a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he’s worth about $100 million)—“great,” but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is “an issue.” Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

On Saturday evening, Trump was addressing his supporters at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when Crooks fired at him. Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized.

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

(Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.\"}\n",
      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/06/26/future-of-tv-business-television-showrunners-bear-season-three-christopher-storer/', 'title': 'Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television', 'date': 'Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Matt Craig', 'content': 'It wasn’t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer’s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be—an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. “The national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,” the account Awful Announcing penned on X. “It is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note.

The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie’s infamous live version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. “With all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was not good.

[+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

[+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.” “She didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,” said Park. “She is just amazing with her punches.” When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, “This is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.” The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.\"}\n",

Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO’s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I’d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don’t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She’s noble and kind for the most part. But she’s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard’s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father’s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King’s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark’s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they’re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that’s really missing—the thing that you can’t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you’re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones—is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I’m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he’s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren’t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters—Tyrion perhaps most of all—are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we’ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There’s always a smirk on Aemond’s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon’s eyes, but you’ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what’s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven’t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn’t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are “about as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.” If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.”'}\n",

[+] field in a break in play against the Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: Pitcher Yusei Kikuchi #16 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on ...

Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/06/28/airline-miles-hotel-points-hacking/', 'title': 'Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points', 'date': 'Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT', 'author': 'Jeremy Bogaisky', 'content': \"Most people don’t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg\\'s two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he\\'s allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.'}\n",

May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University’s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University’s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported.

May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University’s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated “40 to 50” who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Grandma.', 'date': 'Jun 30, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Chloe Sorvino', 'content': \"From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan’s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan’s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that’s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. “I wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,” says Gill, “One that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.” The mass appeal of Bachan’s is one of many reasons why Gill’s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan’s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan’s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan’s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan’s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan’s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce—in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. “I bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,” Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan’s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is “totally self-sustainable.” “At a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,” says Gill. “But A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.” Gill’s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill’s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill’s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family’s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother’s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. “I wanted to do something I love,” Gill recalls, “and really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.” It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. “I really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we’d have something totally different,” says Gill. “And if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.” The 10 ingredients Bachan’s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality—certainly more premium than what Gill’s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan’s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan’s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year—from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan’s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” says Damon Keith, Walmart’s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan’s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends—one for $100,000 was tied to his home—but he couldn’t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan’s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan’s—to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the “ethnic” aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there’s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan’s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan’s became the top seller in the grocer’s barbecue sauce aisle. “It can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It’s really regionally driven,” says Whole Foods’ Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. “What's exciting about Bachan’s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce—but in a totally different way.” In 2021, Gill raised Bachan’s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon’s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. “It was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,” says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude’s managing partner and cofounder. “But it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.” It was Gill’s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan’s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan’s, which Sonoma’s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been “just mind-blowing to me as an investor.” “It's a Sriracha 2.0,” Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. “Sriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan’s in the same way.” That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America’s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan’s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan’s even got mentioned by Walmart’s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan’s as an example of how he’s “personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.” Bachan’s has “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” adds Damon Keith, Walmart’s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan’s has “performed very well and grown share.” After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan’s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he’s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and “going deeper” in the category. As awareness of Bachan’s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. “We want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,” says Gill. “I want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.”\"}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). “It’s an honor,” said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. “It’s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity. So that’s all behind us know and we’re just going to move forward.” — Alexander on coming back from his suspension • No. 30 — RB AJ Dillon • No. 29 — LB Isaiah McDuffie • No. 28 — CB Carrington Valentine • No. 27 — TE Tucker Kraft • No. 26 — LB Edgerrin Cooper • No. 25 — DE Lukas Van Ness • No. 24 — Keisean Nixon • No. 23 — WR Dontayvion Wicks • No. 22 — OL Jordan Morgan • No. 21 — DL T.J.

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump’s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump’s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump’s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he’s hoping he’ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he’d be “disappointed” if he wasn’t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he’s not Trump’s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn’t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum—a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he’s worth about $100 million)—“great,” but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is “an issue.” Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits.

This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.\"}\n",
      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/06/26/future-of-tv-business-television-showrunners-bear-season-three-christopher-storer/', 'title': 'Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television', 'date': 'Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Matt Craig', 'content': 'It wasn’t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer’s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be—an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. “The national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,” the account Awful Announcing penned on X. “It is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,” added another X user. “I’m so sorry, I’m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I’ve ever heard in my whole life,” wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie’s infamous live version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. “With all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was not good. I’m sorry, but it wasn’t. We’re all thinking it and it has to be said,” wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

[+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

[+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.” “She didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,” said Park. “She is just amazing with her punches.” When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, “This is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.” The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.\"}\n",

It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO’s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I’d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don’t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She’s noble and kind for the most part. But she’s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard’s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father’s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King’s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark’s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they’re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that’s really missing—the thing that you can’t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you’re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones—is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I’m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he’s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren’t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters—Tyrion perhaps most of all—are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we’ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There’s always a smirk on Aemond’s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon’s eyes, but you’ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what’s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven’t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn’t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are “about as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.” If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.”'}\n",

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration.

Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming.

That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg\\'s two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he\\'s allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.'}\n",

(Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images) West told “The Download” podcast host Justin LaBoy last week he and Ty Dolla $ign would release “Vultures 2” on May 3—nearly two months after its originally planned release date of March 8. But West and Ty Dolla $ign have been silent on social media the day before the album’s alleged release—West even deactivated his X and Instagram accounts last week. West collaborator and creative director Aus Taylor posted “Vultures 2 en route” on Instagram yesterday, though he did not specify whether the album would arrive May 3. Some of West’s fans on social media are anticipating the album won’t come out Friday. Over the past week, West released a new music video directed by his 10-year-old daughter North West for his song “Talking,” a cut from “Vultures 1,” and he dropped a remix to Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” to diss Drake amid his feud with Kendrick Lamar—but neither seem to have anything to do with “Vultures 2.” West had a notoriously bumpy rollout for “Vultures 1,” his latest album released in February. The album was initially set for release in December, then January, until West and Ty Dolla $ign announced the album would finally drop Feb. 9. The album, however, didn’t show up on streaming services until the following day, Feb. 10. At the time, West said the two sequel volumes in his “Vultures” trilogy would release March 8 and April 5—but he’s since missed both of these deadlines. “Vultures 1” was also plagued by a dispute with the distribution company FUGA that led to the album briefly disappearing from Apple Music, as well as legal action over the allegedly unauthorized use of samples. West was sued in Los Angeles federal court by Donna Summer’s estate for sampling her 1977 hit, “I Feel Love,” after allegedly being denied permission. Ozzy Osbourne also reportedly threatened legal action against West for sampling one of his live performances after Osbourne had rejected permission. “Vultures 1” was West’s first album release since the antisemitic comments that shattered his billionaire status after Adidas dropped its partnership with the rapper. Fan account Ye Fanatics claims West said he may not put “Vultures 2” on streaming services, allegedly stating in an Instagram direct message that streaming “devalues music.” According to screenshots of the ostensible exchange, West instead suggested he may release the album solely for sale through his website. How “Vultures 2” will fare on the charts. “Vultures 1” previously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the single “Carnival” went No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100—but if West follows through on his supposed promise to withhold “Vultures 2” from streaming services, the album’s chart performance may suffer. If released on Friday, “Vultures 2” would face chart competition from Dua Lipa’s “Radical Optimism,” also set for release May 3, as well as the continued success of “The Tortured Poets Department,” the latest album from Taylor Swift, with whom West had long feuded.

The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University’s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University’s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported. May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported—10 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school’s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University’s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated “40 to 50” who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Grandma.', 'date': 'Jun 30, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Chloe Sorvino', 'content': \"From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan’s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan’s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that’s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. “I wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,” says Gill, “One that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.” The mass appeal of Bachan’s is one of many reasons why Gill’s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan’s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan’s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan’s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan’s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan’s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce—in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. “I bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,” Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan’s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is “totally self-sustainable.” “At a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,” says Gill. “But A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.” Gill’s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill’s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill’s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family’s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother’s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. “I wanted to do something I love,” Gill recalls, “and really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.” It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. “I really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we’d have something totally different,” says Gill. “And if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.” The 10 ingredients Bachan’s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality—certainly more premium than what Gill’s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan’s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan’s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year—from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan’s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” says Damon Keith, Walmart’s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan’s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends—one for $100,000 was tied to his home—but he couldn’t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan’s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan’s—to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the “ethnic” aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there’s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan’s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan’s became the top seller in the grocer’s barbecue sauce aisle. “It can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It’s really regionally driven,” says Whole Foods’ Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. “What's exciting about Bachan’s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce—but in a totally different way.” In 2021, Gill raised Bachan’s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon’s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. “It was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,” says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude’s managing partner and cofounder. “But it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.” It was Gill’s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan’s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan’s, which Sonoma’s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been “just mind-blowing to me as an investor.” “It's a Sriracha 2.0,” Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. “Sriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan’s in the same way.” That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America’s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan’s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan’s even got mentioned by Walmart’s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan’s as an example of how he’s “personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.” Bachan’s has “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” adds Damon Keith, Walmart’s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan’s has “performed very well and grown share.” After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan’s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he’s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and “going deeper” in the category. As awareness of Bachan’s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. “We want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,” says Gill. “I want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.”\"}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity.

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio: Speculation grew last week that Vance was at the top of Trump’s list when Axios reported Donald Trump Jr. will speak just before Trump’s VP pick at the RNC, meaning Trump. Jr (who has endorsed Vance for the No. 2 spot) will be tasked with introducing Trump’s running mate. Vance is among four VP frontrunners who received formal inquiries from the campaign earlier this month, along with Sen. Marco Rubio, R.Fla., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., according to multiple outlets, and Vance has made clear he’s hoping he’ll get the job, telling Fox & Friends recently he’d be “disappointed” if he wasn’t selected. Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla.: Rubio was informed Monday he’s not Trump’s running mate, multiple outlets reported after Trump repeatedly teased that he could tap Rubio during an appearance with him at a rally in Doral, Florida on last week. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum: Burgum was also informed Monday he didn’t get the job, according to multiple outlets, after Trump on Wednesday called Burgum—a successful former tech executive (Forbes estimates he’s worth about $100 million)—“great,” but said the strict North Dakota abortion ban he signed is “an issue.” Sen. Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

(Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.\"}\n",

Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

[+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

[+] men's gold medal match against Team Brazil at International Stadium Yokohama on August 07, 2021 in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. (Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.” “She didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,” said Park. “She is just amazing with her punches.” When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, “This is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.” The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.\"}\n",

Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

I could rattle off a bunch of names: Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Bronn, The Hound, Ayra Stark, Sam Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer and the list goes on and on. If you asked me the same thing about HBO’s prequel series, House Of The Dragon, I’d have just as hard a time, but for a very different reason: I just don’t like most of these characters very much at all, and the ones I do I tend to like at more of a superficial level. Sure, I like Rhaenyra. She’s noble and kind for the most part. But she’s also a participant in a bloody war that will leave her country in ashes simply because she thinks she ought to be queen. Compare that to the reason Robb Stark fought a war. He marched south to save his father, Ned, from the Lannisters. When the boy king, Joffrey, had Eddard’s head lopped off in a fit of pique, Robb continued that war both to avenge his father’s death and to rescue his sisters. He also fought for independence for the North which, after the way the Starks were treated by the lords of King’s Landing for the last two generations, strikes me as beyond justified. Why are Rhaenyra and Alicent fighting? Because they disagree about which Targaryen should rule the Seven Kingdoms. Wars of succession are common enough throughout history, but it strikes me as largely vanity, more akin to the Baratheon brothers than to the Stark’s efforts in Game Of Thrones. Jacerys reminds me most of the young Starks. He is good-natured, kind, brave and noble. There is little about Jace or his cousins, Baela and Rhaena, not to like. They are probably the most likeable characters in all of House of the Dragon, but they’re also secondary figures at this point, with little screentime or importance compared to their elders. But the thing that’s really missing—the thing that you can’t quite put your finger on when you wonder why you’re having a harder time relating to House of the Dragon compared to Game of Thrones—is a sense of humor. This show has next to zero comic relief. Game Of Thrones was bursting with it. I’m not suggesting that a dark and gritty fantasy epic about civil war between dragonriders should be a comedy, but the darker a story the more crucial comic relief becomes. Breaking Bad is an incredibly dark crime drama, but Vince Gilligan and his team cast mostly comic actors for the roles, and the show was extremely funny throughout. This made all the bleak stuff much more palatable. Braveheart is one of my favorite movies, and as dramatic and tragic as it is, there are many scraps of humor throughout. One of its most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Irishman, Stephen, precisely because he’s so weird and hilarious. Game Of Thrones gets us to care about its characters because they are often very funny. Their humor makes them feel more relatable, more human, more like us. Even the ever-dour Jon Snow is given funny characters to interact with, from Ygritte to Tormund Giantsbane. Others, like Sam Tarly, aren’t so much funny as they are adorable. But the very best characters—Tyrion perhaps most of all—are full of wit. Tyrion, at least for the first few seasons before his character arc was thrown into the void that was the Daenerys storyline, met every obstacle with a wisecrack and grin. His closest allies, like Bronn, were just as droll. There is simply nothing like this in House of the Dragon. Whatever meager bits of comic relief we’ve been given are soon cast aside for some other dramatic or tragic or ugly or terrible calamity. There’s always a smirk on Aemond’s lips and a dangerous smile behind Daemon’s eyes, but you’ll find no merriment there. Bronn was a violent man, but his smile was still genuine. The Hound was about as stoic as they come, but his odd couple adventures with Arya were often hilarious. This is what’s missing. I love House of the Dragon, but I haven’t fallen in love with any of its characters and that makes me care a lot less about what happens to them. Even the tragic death of Rhaenys earlier this season, as sad as it was, didn’t impact me the way major Game of Thrones deaths did, and I suspect that for all the death and horror still to come, none of it will resonate as much. As I noted in my review of Season 2, Episode 5, the characters in this show are “about as funny as Stannis Baratheon at a barbecue.” If I had one wish for Season 3, it would be that the showrunners and writers introduced some comic relief, even if it meant inventing new characters just to get the job done. Because I know where this story goes and it goes very, very dark. And as an old witch of Westeros once said: “A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.”'}\n",

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others.

Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices.

Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/06/28/airline-miles-hotel-points-hacking/', 'title': 'Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points', 'date': 'Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT', 'author': 'Jeremy Bogaisky', 'content': \"Most people don’t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar.

The arrests include hundreds of protesters at Columbia, UCLA and Emerson University. May 2At least 12 people were arrested in Portland, Oregon after protesters occupied the Millar Library on Portland State University’s campus, The Oregonian confirmed. May 2At least 200 people were arrested in Los Angeles after police raided the encampment at UCLA early Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. May 2In Hanover, New Hampshire, about 90 people were arrested at Dartmouth University’s encampment, police in the city said in a statement, and will be charged with trespassing and resisting arrest. May 2Another 12 people were arrested overnight at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, including 10 students, the Portsmouth Herald reported. May 1Four people, including two students, were arrested after about 200 protesters surrounded the home of Yale president Peter Salovey on Wednesday night, The Yale Daily News reported—10 days after 47 protesters were arrested at the school’s encampment. May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing. April 30One-hundred nine people were arrested on Columbia University’s campus on Tuesday night, including an estimated “40 to 50” who had previously occupied Hamilton Hall, who the NYPD said could face felony charges for burglary. April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

[+] ahead of its third flight test from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas on March 12, 2024. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n",

(Photo by Jo Hale/Redferns) The Rolling Stones are one of a handful of musical acts who maintain an almost constant presence on the U.K. charts. The homegrown favorites are still going strong on the albums ranking in the country where they got their start, and this week, they reach a magical number they’ve never seen before. Forty Licks, the band’s greatest hits compilation, hits 104 weeks on the U.K. albums chart this time around. That’s exactly two years on the tally–and it’s the first release from the band to make it to that landmark. This time around, Forty Licks backtracks slightly from where it ranked last period. The set slips from No. 82 to No. 88, but that decline doesn’t mean much. It’s common for titles that have spent months, if not years, on the chart to rise and fall regularly. Forty Licks is the only project from the Rolling Stones to hold on for triple-digit frames on the U.K. albums chart. Their second-longest-charting title is far behind the compilation, and likely won’t be able to catch up. The band’s self-titled album has thus far spent 51 weeks on the chart in the U.K.—just one frame shy of a full year. Their Rolled Gold set is one turn behind that, with 50 stints on the list. Forty Licks debuted at No. 2 on the U.K. albums chart in October 2002. It peaked in that position, where it sat for several frames before eventually sliding down on the ranking. The compilation slipped off the chart in 2007 and wasn’t seen for well over a decade. Forty Licks returned to the competitive list in 2023, and since then, it’s managed to hold on fairly consistently, with only a short break away from the tally.'}\n",

Grandma.', 'date': 'Jun 30, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Chloe Sorvino', 'content': \"From a headquarters nestled between vineyards in Sonoma County, California, pounds of ginger, rice vinegar, mirin and sesame oil are sent to be mixed into large vats of what will soon become Bachan’s Japanese barbecue sauce. The various flavors will then be piped into its signature plastic squeeze bottles. Justin Gill, Bachan’s 43-year-old founder and CEO, points out that, he was first to use the now-trendy packaging that’s ubiquitous on grocery store shelves. “I wanted to build a brand that was approachable and accessible,” says Gill, “One that would work just as well at Whole Foods as it would in Walmart.” The mass appeal of Bachan’s is one of many reasons why Gill’s sweet and savory sauce started to stick soon after he launched the brand in 2019. A beloved family recipe is another. Bachan’s, named after the Japanese American term for granny, originated from a sauce his own grandmother-made for decades. Bachan’s is now the top-selling barbecue sauce at both Amazon and Whole Foods, and the fastest-growing condiment brand in the country. With estimated annual revenue topping $70 million, Bachan’s is having the kind of moment that made Sriracha founder David Tran a billionaire. Bachan’s is profitable, too, and Forbes estimates operating margins are as much as 20% annually. Gill declined to comment on the revenue or profitability of his private business. At a conservative 5 times multiple, Bachan’s could be worth more than $350 million, and his company could get acquired for a lot more. Spice, after all, sells. In 2020, McCormick spent $800 million buy Cholula hot sauce—in a deal valued at 10 times revenue. Other recent deals for bold-flavored condiment brands have sold for as high as 8 times. “I bootstrapped for so long and took so much personal financial risk to be able to control my business and then become profitable,” Gill says. He has held onto the majority ownership, even after raising $17 million from investors over two rounds and making sure that all of Bachan’s employees, from the warehouse to the headquarters, own their own shares. Gill credits his control with fighting for the right terms when dealmaking, instead of going for bigger valuations. He says he has no plans to raise more in the short-term, adding that the company is “totally self-sustainable.” “At a certain point, you kind of just have to take the risk,” says Gill. “But A key part of our success has been our strategy of being very disciplined.” Gill’s entrepreneurial journey starts with his own bachan, Judy Yokoyama. A first-generation Japanese American who spent two years as a child at a Japanese internment camp in the Colorado desert called Camp Amache, Yokoyama lived with Gill’s family while he grew up in Sebastopol, California, and he remembers her consistently brewing large batches of the heirloom recipe. Throughout Gill’s childhood in Sonoma County, Yokoyama made some anytime there was a big gathering or holiday. At Christmastime, the sauce was gifted to clients of the family’s landscape design business. Handing out bottles door-to-door with the rest of his family left an impression on Gill, who loved when recipients would show off empty bottles from the previous year. Gill cherished his grandmother’s secret recipe, and, in 2013, after years of working with his family in landscape design, he decided to bring the sauce to the masses. “I wanted to do something I love,” Gill recalls, “and really wanted to show my daughters what's possible in life if you chase your dream and just give everything you have to it.” It took six years of testing out different formulations at different plants in California before Gill was satisfied. Mass-produced condiments get made at scale thanks to preservatives and pasteurizing, but that ruined the taste and texture of the sauce Gill remembered from his childhood. Gill, who studied chemistry and horticulture plant science at California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, eventually figured out how to engineer a process to cold-fill the sauce into its bottles, negating the need to pasteurize. “I really saw that all condiments are made in [the same] manner, so, if I could make mine taste like our home recipe, we’d have something totally different,” says Gill. “And if I could do it without any preservatives or a bunch of oils, then I would have something that would be an amazing product and truly represent my family.” The 10 ingredients Bachan’s uses today are minimally processed and high-quality—certainly more premium than what Gill’s middle-class family originally used, he says. Take one of the key ingredients, mirin. The type of mirin Bachan’s sources has been made by the same family in Japan for seven generations. After Bachan’s launched in 2019, Gill took it upon himself to hawk the sauce himself. He gave out samples at stores every weekend in that first year—from natural food stores around Northern California to specialty stores near the headquarters in Sebastopol. When the pandemic hit, the home he shares with his wife and three young daughters became Bachan’s fulfillment center. Hip Dip: Bachan's “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” says Damon Keith, Walmart’s director of merchandising for condiments. As Bachan’s began earning revenue, Gill reinvested it back into Facebook ads, and took out loans to pour in even more. It was a grueling cycle: 50% of daily revenue went back to paying high-interest loans. Committed to bootstrapping, Gill took on two personal loans from friends—one for $100,000 was tied to his home—but he couldn’t get a small business loan so he maxed out credit cards. Then he invested the money into more social media ads and bigger production runs. The boost worked, and Bachan’s quickly rose to become the top-selling barbecue sauce on Amazon. Out of the gates, grocery store buyers tried to relegate Bachan’s—to the global flavors aisle, which was then referred to as the “ethnic” aisle. Gill fought to compete on shelves next to other barbecue sauce brands, where there’s typically more foot traffic in stores, and the bet paid off. Spins, which tracks sales at grocers, estimates the barbeque sauce market at $1 billion, as a rise in regionality has gained traction among shoppers. Whole Foods was willing to try it out, and Bachan’s launched in 60 stores, where Bachan’s became the top seller in the grocer’s barbecue sauce aisle. “It can be challenging for brands to penetrate sauce and barbecue sauce. It’s really regionally driven,” says Whole Foods’ Lizette Coello, who manages global flavors and condiment buying. “What's exciting about Bachan’s is they really re-energize this category that's deeply rooted in American tradition with all the things you want in a good sauce—but in a totally different way.” In 2021, Gill raised Bachan’s first round of capital, after an investor at Prelude Growth Partners realized the company had no institutional backers, yet it had maintained its position as Amazon’s No. 1 selling barbecue sauce. Prelude bought a minority stake for $4 million. “It was the smallest brand at the time of our investment that we've invested in across all of our businesses,” says Neda Daneshzadeh, Prelude’s managing partner and cofounder. “But it was because we had such conviction in him as a founder and in the brand.” It was Gill’s first big moment of relief: a large sum of cash in the bank. By the time Bachan’s went back to investors in 2022, the company had become profitable, and that put Gill at a position of strength. His second round, led by Sonoma Brands Capital, closed at $13 million. What drew in Sonoma to the brand was customers' reactions to Bachan’s, which Sonoma’s founder Jon Sebastiani says has been “just mind-blowing to me as an investor.” “It's a Sriracha 2.0,” Sebastiani says of the hot sauce that made David Tran a billionaire. “Sriracha took the world by storm and is this phenomenal condiment that's just become ubiquitous with Asian cuisine and used on non-Asian food. I see Bachan’s in the same way.” That vote of confidence helped Gill take his biggest leap yet: launching into Walmart. Gill had backed off when America’s largest retailer expressed interest several years earlier, but once he decided that Bachan’s was ready for Walmart, it became an instant hit. Bachan’s even got mentioned by Walmart’s U.S. CEO John Furner during an earnings call in May 2023, which rarely happens for food brands. Furner used Bachan’s as an example of how he’s “personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.” Bachan’s has “set fire in the marketplace and inspired other companies to create their own versions of the sauce,” adds Damon Keith, Walmart’s U.S. director of merchandising for sauces and condiments, who adds that Bachan’s has “performed very well and grown share.” After launching in 3,000 stores last year, 1,000 more got added this year. Now that Bachan’s is sold in 25,000 stores nationwide, Gill says he’s hyper-focused on reaching even more customers and “going deeper” in the category. As awareness of Bachan’s increases, Gill then wants to continue to build by moving into adjacent products, like dipping sauces. “We want to be the first iconic Japanese American food, and when I say iconic, I mean we want to be Heinz ketchup and Tabasco hot sauce,” says Gill. “I want to be ubiquitous in American culture. That allows us to also share our culture and my family legacy.”\"}\n",

Millsap', 'content': 'The assembly line for the 1940 Ford two door sedan, Detroit, Michigan, 1940. (Photo by Underwood ... [+] Archives/Getty Images) President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are competing to convince voters that they alone can protect manufacturing jobs, promising to use tariffs, “Buy American” rules, and subsidies to get the job done. Their supporters praise their efforts, convinced that the manufacturing jobs once common in the 1950s and 60s are vital to U.S. prosperity. This nostalgia is misplaced. We should not mourn the decline of manufacturing employment that has released millions of people from dull, uninteresting work. That may sound harsh, but I know from experience. I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, a classic Rust Belt city built around manufacturing companies like General Motors (GM), Frigidaire, National Cash Register, and Delco Electronics. One summer while I was in college I worked at Moraine Assembly, a GM factory located just south of Dayton. GM hired college students to fill in for assembly line workers who were on their summer vacations since the line only works if there is someone at every station. This was during the early aughts SUV craze, so demand was strong for the midsize SUVs—GMC Jimmy, Chevy Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada—assembled at the plant. We made roughly 500 vehicles per shift, two shifts per day. The pay was relatively good, about $13 per hour at a time when the federal minimum wage was $5.15. This included an hourly bonus since I worked the swing shift—two days on the early shift, two days off, then two days on the late shift. Most of the regular workers, especially the more senior ones, disliked the swing shift because it messed up their sleep schedule and interfered with their family lives. I was a college kid unconcerned about regular sleep with no family to care for, so taking the extra money was an easy choice. Late shifts are one notable drawback of factory work. An overnight shift is not a pro-family job since you need to sleep when your spouse and kids are awake. I got off the late shift around 4:00 AM then slept most of the day before going back in around 5:30 PM, leaving only a few waking hours to spend time with friends and family. Eliminating overnight shifts may seem like a solution, but usually it does not make financial sense. Factories are more profitable the more they produce since the fixed costs of the building and machinery can be spread over more output. If demand is high enough, it makes sense to run a factory 24 hours a day. Moraine Assembly had two 10 hour shifts per day, so it essentially did that. Some jobs require night shifts—doctors, nurses, police—but if automation can eliminate a night shift job, we should let it. Over the years, machines without families that can operate 24 hours a day have eliminated many night shift jobs, and that is a pro-family development we should celebrate. The swing shift took some getting used to, but the worst part of the job by far was its dullness. As I mentioned, we made about 500 vehicles per shift, meaning each person did the same thing 500 times per day. These were not complicated jobs. They taught a college kid like me how to do one in about 10 minutes. Then a supervisor or another full-time worker watched me for another 10 to 15 minutes to make sure I got the hang of it. After about an hour, I was as good as someone who had done the job for 20 years. In a way I was lucky. Because I filled in for people, I moved around more often than most. The two jobs I spent the most time at were attaching gas tanks to the frame and installing a control arm, which is part of the front suspension system. I also installed spare tire mounts, rear axles, engine mounts, and worked on the trim line installing speaker wire. I quickly got the hang of each job, then boredom kicked in. Line work allows your mind to wander. It is like driving on the highway: Your hands are doing something, but you do not need to think about it. So, you think about other things: Plans for your day off; what you would do if you won the lottery; how well your favorite sports team will perform next season. You dwell on problems: Can I pay my bills? Will my significant other still be mad at me when I get off? Why is my kid struggling at school? These worries could drive you crazy. It was loud in Moraine Assembly so some people, including me, used ear plugs, which made it difficult to talk with your neighbors to break up the monotony. Others listened to radios with the volume set just high enough to overcome some of the noise. There was not a lot of relationship building on the factory floor. This job convinced me that humans are not meant for assembly line work. It is hard to form bonds with coworkers. There are no problems to solve, no new challenges to overcome, and no thrill of achievement. The slog of factory work goes against our human nature. We enjoy challenges, value novelty, and delight in tinkering and experimentation. Factory work provides none of that. When I discuss this in conversation people tend to agree, at least partially. But then some say the quiet part out loud: We need factory work because some people are just not capable of anything else. That is rubbish. In his book Mass Flourishing, economist Edmund Phelps reminds us that, “Even the worker of ordinary education can be engaged in and can gain intellectual development from the formation of skills…arising from problems that are put to him or her in the workplace”. We should not protect jobs we do not need because we think a portion of the population needs something to keep them busy. People are capable of things even they may not realize, and if government is going to put its thumb on the scale it should be doing so in a way that challenges us to reach our potential rather than coddles us with jobs better performed by mindless machines. In addition to these shortcomings, factory jobs are mediocre jobs by more traditional criteria. As The Economist recently noted, job security, safety, and benefits in service-sector jobs typically meet or exceed those of manufacturing jobs. According to the most recent wage data, average hourly earnings of private service-providing jobs are $34.84, slightly higher than the $34.00 average hourly earnings of manufacturing jobs. This simple comparison includes workers in higher-wage service industries such as financial services and information technology, but even when researchers control for education, age, and other worker characteristics, they find that the manufacturing wage premium has disappeared. The manufacturing sector also has a productivity problem. Since the start of 2021, manufacturing labor productivity growth has averaged -0.1% at an annual rate compared to 2% for the economy as a whole. This bodes poorly for future wage growth in the industry since productivity growth drives wage growth. If the typical manufacturing job does not pay better or provide better benefits than other jobs, there is even less reason for the government to protect it. To be clear, this does not mean we should not make things in America, nor is it a criticism of factory workers. All productive work is noble and a society that does not value work will not last long. But romanticizing labor-intensive manufacturing undermines the innovation and dynamism that generates more fulfilling work. The kind of work that challenges the mind as well as the body. The kind of work that pushes us to learn and develop new skills. The kind of work fit for humans capable of solving complex problems. Six hundred years ago most of our ancestors eked out a living off the land. Sixty years ago, many of them enjoyed a more comfortable life, though arguably more boring, by tightening the same screws every day. Neither situation was great and longing for the latter makes no more sense than longing for the former. In Mass Flourishing, Phelps argues that modern economies are good because they generate more opportunities for people to pursue the good life. They “serve people’s urge to imagine and create the new…to seek to innovate, and their desire to pioneer new practice.” Using government policy to save traditional manufacturing jobs would be a setback, not a step forward.'}\n",

WWE Raw advertised Rhea Ripley’s return to Monday nights in her first promo since going down with injury. Ripley made a surprise return following last week’s main event, almost catching Dominik Mysterio in the act of kissing Liv Morgan. Raw also advertised a showdown between Damian Priest and GUNTHER, Drew McIntyre’s return, Sheamus vs. Bronson Reed and Ilja Dragunov challenging Sami Zayn for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Last week’s broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.750 million viewers.       A furious Rhea Ripley called out Liv Morgan while ignoring an apologetic Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan had a fantastic monologue about taking everything from Ripley and how her coup de grace would be taking Dom. At one point, the out-of-pocket Morgan said her voice was hoarse because she had a wild weekend in Mexico City and has always been “a bit of a screamer.” Rhea Ripley vowed to end Morgan’s career. Mysterio tried to give her a black rose, which she rejected. Dom also decorated Ripley’s dressing room, but she destroyed it as well. This was around the same time as a virally awful national anthem by Ingrid Andress ahead of the Home Run Derby. Pat McAfee made mention of the national anthem to discourage viewers from watching the Derby, but all the mention made me want to do was go on Twitter and watch that anthem myself. Sheamus defeating Bronson Reed felt a lot like when longtime veteran Sami Zayn beat up-and-coming Bron Breakker. Reed was being set up to rebuild his momentum but he was subjected to a “pay your dues” type loss. It seemed as if Sonya Deville was going to manage Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark, but it might be the opposite with Deville featured as a singles star with Stark and Baszler as her heavies. Sonya Deville made quick work of Zelina Vega. As Vega, Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark did a number on Vega’s arm, Kayden Carter, Katana Chance and Lyra Valkyria hit the ring but the heels didn’t budge. Boy did the babyfaces look weak in this moment. Both Damian Priest and GUNTHER are still technically heels, though Priest is moving closer toward being a babyface every week. Still, people didn’t know how to take these two. They seemed confused about whom to cheer. Priest cut a great babyface promo in response to GUNTHER saying WWE “was not his dream.” Priest said he grew up fighting for his life on the street. GUNTHER then cut a great heel promo about how living on the streets is a choice because Priest’s parents chose not to raise him, while GUNTHER had great parents. It really struck a nerve with this crowd, especially when GUNTHER called Priest “street trash.” By the end of the GUNTHER-Priest exchange, Priest was the clear babyface. Poor Braun Strowman was in an awkward position as a babyface against the heel champion who just transitioned into a babyface. Strowman was excessively selling his knee after charging at Damian Priest only for Priest to move and derail the Strowman Express. Priest peppered Strowman with a series of spin kicks. As Strowman made a last-ditch rally, his knee gave out, which led to Priest winning with the South of Heaven. GUNTHER and Priest brawled after Priest’s win, and Priest got the better of GUNTHER. Fan have not warmed up to Chance and Carter’s entrance just yet, but they have a lot of crowd-pleasing double-team moves that get fans to react. This match was very competitive considering how much WWE is heating up Deville Baszler and Stark. Even when Deville interrupted, she was thwarted by Lyra Valkyria. There was an excellent finish where Baszler and Stark hit an unnamed double-team move where Stark yeeted Chance into a Sonya knee. Drew McIntyre was surprisingly giddy headed to the ring. WWE once again aired footage from Money in the Bank when McIntyre told CM Punk “I know where your family lives!” Perhaps Drew made good on that promise? Adam Pearce said he wanted to make the match between Drew McIntyre and CM Punk, but he wouldn’t do so until McIntyre apologized to the referees for putting his hands on him during his MITB tirade. Fans chanted “say you’re sorry.” Not only did McIntyre refuse to apologize, he also attacked the referees once again. This brought out Seth Rollins who brawled with McIntyre. Either Seth is being added as a backup in case Punk can’t go, or there will be a Triple Threat match. Drew McIntyre was re-suspended amid all this, so I fully expect the suspension to be lifted by next week. During the latest Wyatt Sicks therapy session, Erick Rowan cut a fantastic promo referencing Brodie Lee and Bray Wyatt. WWE played on social media memes and months of teases by having Jey Uso show interest in Rhea Ripley, who he presumed was now single. Dominik started the match like a house afire, cutting off Jey’s entrance and screaming “don’t you ever mess with my Mami!” The climax of this match (no pun intended) came when Liv Morgan tried to help Dom. Jey Uso hit a baseball slide dropkick on Dom, causing him to “accidentally” land on top of Liv, only to be straddled by her. Rhea Ripley stormed the ring, causing Liv to flee the ring and a distracted Dom took a Spear and a Splash for the loss. After the match, Rhea Ripley returned Dominik’s rose and said she doesn’t belong to anyone. She’s not Dom’s, he’s hers. Apparently they’re back together. Chad Gable called out Bo Dallas, and Dallas was attacked by the Creed Brothers and thrown around like a rag doll. Unfortunately for them, Dallas was laughing after the beatdown. While laughing, Dallas said “yeah, yeah yeah” in tribute to Brodie Lee. Then the Wyatt Sicks music played and fans chanted “you F’d up!” Chad and both Creeds fled the scene at the sight of the Wyatt Sicks. Earlier in the night, Bron Breakker was escorted out of the arena by Adam Pearce. I fully expect this show to end with Breakker spearing everything in sight. This match was built around Ilja Dragunov’s constant motion as the guy “never stops.” Fans weren’t as into this match because if Sami Zayn was able to beat GUNTHER and Bron Breakker, it’s difficult to believe Ilja was going to pull off the upset. Fans turned on Ilja Dragunov late in the match as Dragunov looked like he was on his way to a win. Breakker inevitably returned, and hit a 360 Spear on ilja Dragunov after Sami rolled out of the way. Breakker then hit the ropes multiple times for a show-ending Spear on Sami Zayn. Fans barked as Raw went off the air.'}\n",

During the decade that Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz anchored the Atlanta Braves pitching rotation, they were simultaneous All-Stars only once, in 1996. But the 2024 Braves duplicated that feat when they placed three starters on the National League roster (three Braves starters also were on the NL team in 1997, when Maddux, Glavine, and Denny Neagle were named). “It’s an honor,” said Chris Sale, who leads major-league pitchers with 13 wins. “It’s a really cool thing, though those guys are in a much better spot [Cooperstown] than we are. To be mentioned with those names is impressive and you always appreciate it.” Fried agreed. “What Chris and Reynaldo (Lopez) have done up to this point is great,” he said. “They’ve given us unbelievably consistent starts, so to be added with them is fabulous. I was definitely honored to be a late add.” Sale has been sailing since arriving in Atlanta from Boston is a straight-up trade for middle infielder Vaughn Grissom. An eight-time All-Star, he shares the record of three straight starts as a pitcher with Hall of Famers Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts. But he’s never won a Cy Young Award. Asked if he was thinking about the trophy, he said only, “I’m thinking I’ve got to start coming up whenever they hand me the ball and I’ll take it from there.” Nor is Fried letting his uncertain future influence his performance. Max Fried, an All-Star for the second time, is one of three Braves starters on the National League ... [+] roster. “I want to focus on what’s happening today,” said Fried, also an All-Star in 2022. “I 100 per cent love the [Atlanta] organization. We’re in the middle of the season and we have to focus on other things. I truly have loved my time here – I love it and would love to stay here.” Fried, a 30-year-old left-hander with a .690 winning percentage and 3.04 earned run average during an eight-year career spent entirely in Atlanta, will be a coveted commodity on the free-agent market if the Braves don’t sign him to a contract extension first. His current contract, which expires after the World Series, pays him $15 million. According to Spotrac, Sale signed to two-year, $38,000,000 contract extension with an average annual salary of $19,000,000. The deal covers the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with the 6\\'6\" southpaw earning $17,000,000 this year. Lopez, signed as a free agent last winter, got a three-year, $30 million contract with an average annual salary of $10,000,000. In 2024, López will earn a base salary of $4,000,000 and $11 million during both the 2025 and 2026 seasons. His $8 million club option for 2027 includes a $4 million buyout. The 29-year-old right-handed power pitcher responded so well when asked to move from relief work to the rotation that he brought baseball’s best earned run average (1.89) into the All-Star Game. Manager Brian Snitker, armed with a powerful bullpen and a need to reach the playoffs with all three horses healthy, has carefully monitored the pitch count, innings pitched, and days between starts for his Big Three. Sale, the oldest NL All-Star at age 35, made an immediate and smooth adjustment to the Atlanta clubhouse. “People talk about getting traded and sometimes it can be tough,” said Sale, who idolized Hall of Famer Randy Johnson, another left-handed power pitcher. “But coming to the Braves was an easy transition because of how open the clubhouse is, how relaxed they are and how they are, very laid back. It was relatively easy because of how those guys are in the clubhouse.” Kidding around with the serious-minded Fried helped. “We were all hitters before we were pitchers,” Sale said Monday during All-Star Workout Day. “You have pitchers who still think they can hit, especially Max, who has a couple of trophies, including the last Silver Slugger for NL pitchers. Nobody grows up as a kid not dreaming of hitting the game-winning home run.” The 94th All-Star Game will be played before a sell-out crowd at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX Tuesday. The second Midsummer Classic to be hosted by the Rangers will not only be played on artificial turf but will feature the oddity of the National League serving as the home team (the leagues alternate every year). The game features 38 first-time All-Stars, 22 players aged 26 or younger, and 28 internationally-born participants, from eight different countries and territories. Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes will be the NL’s starting pitcher but may work only an inning, according to manager Torey Lovullo, with the left-handed Fried likely to follow since he last started Thursday. In his last start, the 22-year-old Skenes worked seven hitless innings before he was removed from the game because of fatigue. He is the fifth freshman to start an All-Star Game but the first since Hideo Nomo in 1995.'}\n",

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Power Trip) TikTok is known as the place where new hits and rising artists break these days. The music industry uses the social media platform to promote just-dropped cuts, and it’s given many musicians a way to cut through the noise and make themselves known when they might otherwise not have had a chance to do so. The platform is largely focused on what’s new and what’s next, but there’s also a place for older releases as well. This week, on Billboard’s chart that focuses specifically on what’s performing the best on TikTok, one of the most successful rock bands of all time returns and earns a brand new hit–one that’s not actually that new at all. AC/DC returns to the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this week. The tally, introduced by the chart company last year, lists the tracks that are the most popular (and most used) on TikTok each tracking period in the U.S. The Australian rockers launch their smash “Thunderstruck” on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this time around. The tune is new to the tally, and it opens at No. 48. That’s fairly low on the 50-spot popularity ranking, but it’s still an important win for the group. “Thunderstruck” marks AC/DC’s second hit on the TikTok chart. That’s a sizable sum for a band that has been around for decades and is largely known for songs they released many years ago. AC/DC first landed on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 this February. Their timeless tune “Back In Black” eventually peaked at No. 25. It spent just two weeks on the list before falling away. “Thunderstruck” has become a trending topic lately, thanks to some exciting news related to the title. The song was recently certified diamond by the RIAA, earning the band their first such honor. Tracks collect that award in the U.S. after they shift a certified 10 million equivalent units–in this country alone, that is.'}\n",

[+] 2023 season. Rebuild? Regress? Hardly. Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness. Green Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL’s youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers — who missed the postseason in 2022 — would take another step back in 2023. Instead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs. Now, with the overwhelming majority of that ascending roster back, a gifted quarterback in Jordan Love, and some key offseason additions, the Packers will return as one of the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX. “I’ve been so close so many years and I’ve been a part of some really good teams. Some great teams,” said Kenny Clark, a defensive tackle who has played in three NFC Championship games, but has been on the losing end each time. “But this group is really coming together, really connecting. “They’ve got a lot of love for each other. It’s built the right way. It’s hard to win in this league, but I think if we take the same approach we took last year, we’ll make some noise and hopefully we can get to that game (the Super Bowl).” Green Bay’s first training camp practice is July 22. Between now and then I will count down the ‘30 Most Important Packers’ heading into the 2024 campaign. At No. 6 is cornerback Jaire Alexander.  Alexander, the NFL’s highest paid cornerback (four years, $84 million), had the worst of his six seasons on the field and was a problem off the field, as well. Alexander played in just seven games due to back and shoulder injuries and was remarkably inconsistent when he did play. Alexander was also suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team following a Week 16 win in Carolina. Each week, the Packers pick three captains to go out for the pre-game coin toss — one from the offense, defense and special teams. Alexander, who grew up in Charlotte, N.C., was not selected as a captain when the Packers met the Panthers, but went out for the coin flip anyhow. Green Bay called the toss because it was the visiting team, and Alexander yelled, “Tails.” It was tails, and Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur had instructed his captains to “defer” the Packers’ choice until the second half. If Alexander said “defer” like Green Bay’s captains undoubtedly would have, Carolina would have been forced to choose and certainly would have gone on offense. Instead, Alexander made the mistake of telling referee Alex Kemp that Green Bay wanted to go on defense. So in essence, Alexander was making the pick instead of forcing Carolina to do so. Had Kemp held the Packers to that declaration, Carolina would have had the choice to start the second half, meaning the Panthers would have begun both halves on offense. Kemp gave the Packers a break, though, and allowed them a second chance to say defer. Green Bay went on to win, 33-30. Had Kemp not cut Alexander and the Packers some slack, they would have lost a possession and quite possibly, lost the game, as well. “I said, 'I want our defense to be out there,' and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander said. “I'm like, I mean it's pretty simple what I said, like I want the defense to be out there. They like, 'You mean defer?' and I'm like, 'Yeah, I guess.' “(Kemp) was just like, 'Defer?' I was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was like, 'Yeah.' Everybody was laughing. I'm like, what y'all laughing at? It's pretty obvious what I'm asking for.” Perhaps. But Alexander should have never been at midfield for the coin toss to begin with. And because Alexander didn't properly articulate LaFleur’s wishes, it could have cost the Packers dearly. “That was a big mistake,” LaFleur said. “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer.’ I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander was suspended for Green Bay’s Week 17 contest at Minnesota, returned the following week and played better down the stretch. In fact, his lone interception of the season came in the Packers’ Wild Card win over Dallas. Overall, though, it was an incredibly disappointing year for Alexander. “It was tough. It was tough on him, tough on me, tough on our team,” LaFleur said of Alexander’s suspension. “But I love how he responded and that’s life. You’ve got two choices, you can either go in the tank or you can try to learn and grow and be better for it. And I think he certainly has taken that approach.”  Alexander, who was general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first-ever draft pick, was named to the NFL’s all-rookie team in 2018, becoming just the second Green Bay cornerback to receive that honor since that team was first constructed in 1974. Alexander led Green Bay’s defensive backs in passes defensed per snap (one every 50.7) that season, was second in tackles per snap (one every 10.0) and committed just two penalties. In 2019, Alexander tied for fourth in the league with 17 passes defensed and had two interceptions. On the flip side, Alexander allowed five touchdowns, dropped two interceptions and missed 14 tackles. Alexander had a breakout 2020 season when Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback in football. According to PFF, Alexander allowed just 353 receiving yards in Green Bay’s 18 games that year — an average of 19.6 yards per game. Alexander also ranked sixth in the league allowing one reception every 15.1 coverage snaps. Opposing quarterbacks completed just 40.6% of the passes they threw at Alexander in 2020. And opposing quarterbacks had a 68.3 rating when targeting Alexander. Alexander had two second half interceptions of Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady in the NFC Championship Game that year. And he finished the season with 16 passes broken up and just one penalty. In the last three seasons, though, the undersized Alexander (5-10, 196) has played in just 30 of 54 games due to injury. Alexander played just four games and 20.3% of the snaps in 2021 after he suffered an AC joint injury in his right shoulder. Alexander was healthy and highly productive in 2022 when he led the Packers with a career-high five interceptions. Alexander had a team-best 14 passes defensed, a career-high four tackles for loss and was largely responsible for holding Minnesota star Justin Jefferson to one catch in a critical Week 17 win. Alexander failed to build on that, though, with a highly disappointing 2023 campaign. Now, as Alexander enters Year 7, he’s at a career crossroads and must prove he’s still worthy of his hefty contract.  Alexander is still just 27 years old and should have several highly productive years ahead of him. But the bombastic Alexander is one of the more enigmatic people to come through Green Bay in some time, and keeping him on the right track could be a challenge. Alexander skipped Green Bay’s OTA’s in 2023, which cost him $700,000. But it was a good sign for all involved that Alexander took part in every phase of the Packers’ offseason program this year. “I feel like I have so much more to put out there and display consistently, and I'm just ready to attack that,” Alexander said this offseason. “Man, I'm super motivated … That's why I'm here.” Green Bay’s move to a more aggressive defense under first-year coordinator Jeff Hafley could help re-energize Alexander. “We’ve got a bunch of athletes on the field who like to make plays and can make plays,” Alexander said. “I think this is going to work really well.”  “Those things are difficult and those are tough. But at the end of the day it allowed us all to reset. I’m really proud of the way Jaire responded to that. I really think that’s going to help us moving forward.” — Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst on suspending Alexander “We’ve seen nothing but his best. He’s leading that (secondary) group the right way. He’s breaking down the groups. A lot of energy every morning. He’s been the same guy, so he’s been a joy to work with that way. We’re proud of that. We don’t take that for granted and we expect a lot out of him because he’s got a lot to give.” — Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley on Alexander “Ja’s been outstanding. Again, he’s been here every day, shows up, great attitude, eager to learn, is out there competing with the guys, talking trash, which I love because I love just amping up that level of competition in a fun way. He’s never demeaning. I think he’s been a great teammate and been a great leader for us.” —Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Alexander “I mean I just had to go out there and ball, show them that I was still me regardless of the adversity.

The fund, created two days ago by Meredith O\\'Rourke, the finance director of the Trump campaign, has raised $4.7 million—several times its $1 million goal. Major donors to the campaign include Musk ($100,000); Griffin ($100,000); billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn ($50,000); Florida Gov.

Nikki Haley, but has so far refrained from donating to Trump’s 2024 campaign. In May, he said he was waiting to see who Trump chooses to run as his vice presidential running mate before deciding whether to donate (Trump on Monday announced Sen. J.D.

Shots were fired at Trump on Saturday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump can be seen on video ducking behind a podium before being swarmed by Secret Service agents, who then escort the former president off stage as he pumps his fist in the air with blood visible on the side of his face. Trump’s injuries were minor, but one supporter was shot and killed, and two others were seriously injured. The suspected shooter, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. Authorities have not yet discovered a motive for the attack. In the wake of the shooting, several billionaires stepped up to express support for the former president or echo calls for a deescalation of campaign rhetoric and condemn political violence. Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world\\'s richest person, tweeted, \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos praised Trump for showing \"grace and courage under literal fire\" and several others issued statements decrying the violence, including Mark Cuban, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff.'}\n",

Law enforcement block a street in Bethel Park, where residence of Thomas Matthew Crooks is located. Details have continued to emerge about the suspect and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks high school classmate Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks, 20, wasn\\'t able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets \"by close to 20 feet\" and described him as a \"terrible shot.\" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man \"knew when someone’s not the greatest person\" and had noted Crooks\\' \"crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.\" The FBI identified the 20-year-old Crooks as the suspected shooter in the early hours of Sunday morning, and said the attack is being investigated as a case of possible domestic terrorism. In a later update on Sunday night, the FBI said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency confirmed earlier reports that it had found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and vehicle, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” The gunman was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident and special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject.” Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service after firing shots at the Trump campaign event from a nearby building outside the rally and an AR-style rifle was recovered at the scene—which the FBI says was purchased legally. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of a nearby building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported citing an anonymous source, who retreated off the roof moments before the Secret Service fired on Crooks. Law enforcement officials said they identified Crooks using his DNA and biometric information. Still image taken from video provided by the Bethel Park School District shows student Thomas ...

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School and registered Republican with no criminal history, the New York Times reported. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. Only 20-years-old at the time of the shooting, Crooks was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” CNN reached Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, on Saturday, but the man said he would not speak to the public about his son until he figured out “what the hell is going on” and spoke to law enforcement. Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” However, another student Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks unlike Kohler—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Another student, Max Smith who took a history class with Crooks told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically] conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is \"grateful\" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” \"We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness,\" Trump posted Sunday morning. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.\" Additional reporting by Siladitya Ray.'}\n",

Fresh off her victory at the 1977 Oscars for her role in Network, Faye Dunaway poses by the swimming pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel in front of her futur husband’s camera, British photographer Terry O\\'Neill. Effortless, elegant and her long overdue golden statuette displayed on the table, this series of photos called The Morning After, will soon add to her status of Hollywood legend. Faye premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year, a very fitting place considering the fact that the actress was the face of the iconic festival in 2011, and that she has been secretly coming to Cannes for years to watch as many movies as possible. “There are two big movie events, the Oscars and Cannes. And to me, it’s more like Cannes and the Oscars, right?” director Laurent Bouzereau told me during an interview. He added: “Sharing that moment with her at the Cannes Film Festival was very surreal for me. Because it’s something that when we got started, we said ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could premiere the film in Cannes?’ So it was a dream come true on so many levels. She was the face of Cannes a few years ago, she loves the French, I think one of the reasons why she did the film is because I was born in France and I have a French name.” It was the second time that Dunaway was going to see Bouzereau’s film, but this time with an audience. Bouzereau told me that the first time they watched it together at HBO, Dunaway spent the entire time writing things down on her little notepad, to the great despair of the director who thought she was going to have notes about the film. When the lights came on, Dunaway was crying and she hugged Bouzereau. He asked her what she was writing down the whole time. She said, “I am just writing the names of the people I need to thank.” Laurent Bouzereau, Faye Dunaway, Liam Dunaway O\\'Neill and McKinzie Roth at the 77th annual Cannes ... [+] Film Festival Growing up in France, Bouzereau first encountered Dunaway watching The Tower Inferno, which was the first movie poster he ever hung up on his bedroom walls. The whole experience is a full circle moment for Bouzereau, whose documentary is also the fruit of his friendship with Dunaway’s son, Liam. The filmmaker was then able to develop the documentary, without shying away from the most complicated aspects of her life, including her reputation. Indeed, Dunaway has been called difficult and hard to work with for decades, but Bouzereau’s documentary does not try to sanitize anything. Right at the beginning of the film, Bouzereau used a clip of Bette Davis telling TV host Johnny Carson that she never wants to work with Dunaway ever again. Bouzereau said, “Right off the bat, I said that certain things are not gonna be pleasant to talk about, because it is tough and there is a reputation there, and I wanted to be honest and raw.” He added: “I said ‘Let’s just film everything, let’s never cut and see what we come up with.’ At the same time, I wanted her to feel safe. I am not a reporter, I am a storyteller, so I’m trying to tell her story, and I just felt that there was a need for a little repair work, because she does have a reputation, that’s out there, on the internet if you google her name. So I didn’t want to shy away from it because I was like, it needs to be honest. So she has a reputation, but I have seen many actors behave just like her, or sometimes worse and by the way, men too.” Bouzereau explained that Dunaway’s reputation is very much shared by people, particularly artists, who put themselves out there. He said, “Not just actors, it could be athletes, painters or musicians. They live so intensely their art, it’s very internal, so when it has to be external, it acts out. I find that to be very relatable, and again, courageous to acknowledge.” Calling a star a diva or difficult has always been easier when the star in question was a woman. Hollywood has always had double standards for women and Faye Dunaway, even though she acknowledges her wrong-doings in the documentary, was certainly judged and slandered in a way none of her male co-stars ever was, as explained by the director James Gray in the documentary. Bouzereau said, “People are talking more about the way that women have been perceived vs men, there has been a gigantic movement worldwide, that I think has helped that dialogue. So a film like this, I think, feeds into that dialogue and hopefully can make a difference as well.” \"Chinatown\", directed by Roman Polanski: Jack Nicholson as J.J. \\'Jake\\' Gittes facing Faye Dunaway as ... [+] Evelyn Cross Mulwray. In the late 60s and throughout the 70s, Dunaway was truly at the height of her career and starred in some true Hollywood classics such as Bonnie and Clyde directed by Arthur Penn, but also in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown alongside Jack Nicholson. Dunaway and Polanski or “Roman the Terror” as she refers to him in the documentary, didn’t get along at all. The director crossed a line when, annoyed by a hair sticking up on Dunaway’s head during the filming of a scene, he walked up to her and pulled the hair out of her head. Obviously, this resulted in Dunaway’s leaving the set and going back to her trailer. We later learn that Dunaway actually suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bouzereau said, “She says in the film ‘I am very much responsible for my actions, I have been known for being difficult and I don’t mean it, I try to control it, but sometimes I can’t.’” He added: “When she was really at her height and potentially struggling with it, it wasn’t even something you could talk about. Whereas people today, who are in the same position, in the media, are able to share with the world what they are going through. And frankly, it makes them relatable.” Bouzereau believes that if a star like Dunaway can share her struggles with her bipolar disorder, it might help people. He said, “Frankly, sometimes I can be obsessive-compulsive myself with certain things, and when she was describing certain things, because we’ve had many discussions away from the camera, we shared stories, it was so great to talk about that.” Faye Dunaway and French director Laurent Bouzereau arrive for the screening of the film \"Furiosa: A ... [+] Mad Max Saga\" at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival Bouzereau directed many documentaries about the biggest legends of Hollywood from Natalie Wood to Harrison Ford, but also behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of cult classic movies including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to name a few. I asked him about his relationship to his subjects while filming, in order to understand how and why they choose to open up to him. Does it all come down to a good filmmaker-subject relationship and chemistry? Or does it all happen through the lens of a camera ? “It is a complex question, but in short, when I am filming with people of that caliber, or people in general, I literally go into a zone. I forget that there’s a camera, I forget there are lights, everything. I am in that zone and I hope that it doesn’t sound pretentious, but I start channeling their emotions. So when Faye was crying and talking about the adoption of Liam, I was in tears. I was really feeling what she was feeling. It wasn’t like ‘I got the story, now I can ove on.’ I was literally exhausted from it.” He added: “I feel the same way each time I film with someone, I want them to feel like I’m almost a mirror to them. That I’m the first audience to what they are saying. And if they see me being emotional and responsive, I think it reassures them that there is something happening in the room.” Faye is now streaming on HBO Max.'}\n",

O'Brien said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention In his speech, O’Brien praised Trump for having “the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention” and claimed the invitation triggered backlash from people on both the left and the right. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet endorsed a candidate and despite the group’s support for Democratic candidates in recent years, O’Brien said: “We are not beholden to anyone or any party.” Despite praising certain Republican leaders like Sen. Josh Hawley and Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, O’Brien also called out the GOP’s “active opposition” to labor unions and said, “this too must change.” O’Brien’s speech was initially met with enthusiastic cheers as he talked about the criticism he’ll face from the left for addressing the RNC, but cheers and applause eventually slowed when he spoke of workers being fired for trying to join unions and “economic terrorism” by big corporates.

The union leader said he has also requested a chance to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but reports say he has not received a response from the Democrats yet. Breaking with convention, the Teamsters’ political arm donated $45,000 to the Republican National Committee earlier this year—matching a similar donation made to the Democratic Party in December. After endorsing President Joe Biden in 2020, the Teamsters union may decide against endorsing any candidate for November’s race, Reuters reported Monday, citing two unnamed sources. This would be a major blow for the Biden campaign, as the union has supported Democratic candidates—like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton—in recent presidential elections. 1.3 million. That is the size of the Teamster union’s membership, according to the group’s website, making them one of the largest labor unions in the country. Roughly a third of Teamster members are UPS workers. In his speech, O’Brien said: “Labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union, but can never get a union contract. Companies fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. This is economic terrorism at its best, an individual cannot withstand such an assault.” In an op-ed written last week, John Palmer, the Teamsters' vice president at large, demanded that O’Brien should not participate in the Republican Convention, writing: “It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done, or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent.” O’Brien was elected as the Teamsters president in 2021. Last year, O’Brien made the news after attending a heated Senate hearing where Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., challenged him to a fistfight. Despite nearly coming to blows with a pro-Trump senator, O’Brien met with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago residence in January for what the union said was an “in-depth and productive discussion on worker issues.” Since then, O’Brien has positioned himself and the union as more bipartisan by donating to both parties and offering to speak at both their conventions. This outreach, however, has been met with pushback from within the union. In a letter, the group’s members, James Curbeam, national chairman of the Teamsters National Black Caucus, called O’Brien a “scab masquerading as a pro-union advocate.” The Teamster leader’s reticence to endorse Biden again has been an outlier in the election so far. Other major unions, including the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, AFSCME, National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, have backed Biden. During O’Brien’s speech, the AFL-CIO tweeted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn't forget. And Project 2025 shows he'll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” Republican National Convention: Trump Makes Appearance Days After Assassination Attempt (Forbes) Trump—With Bandaged Ear And Misty Eyes—Appears At Republican Convention (Photos) (Forbes)\"}\n",

Tim Scott, S.C.: Scott told a Newsmax reporter in May, a day after appearing at a Manhattan fundraiser with Trump, “if you’re the guy moderating [the vice presidential debate], maybe I’ll be talking to you,” adding “we’ll see, we’ll see,” when asked whether he will be on Trump’s ticket. Ben Carson: The campaign has also requested information from the former neurosurgeon who served as Trump’s Housing and Urban Development secretary, ABC reported, noting it’s unclear how extensive the request was. Rep. Elise Stefanik, N.Y.: The Republican Conference chair is one of Trump’s most loyal supporters in Congress: she was the first GOP congressional leader to endorse his 2024 presidential bid, consistently promotes his election fraud claims and frequently criticizes his legal troubles in TV interviews (the campaign reportedly asked her for information, as well). Rep. Byron Donalds, Fla.: Donalds attended Trump’s trial in May, and reportedly got a request for vetting information, but Trump suggested last month he would support Donalds in another role: Florida governor, NBC reported, citing an unnamed source. Sen. Tom Cotton, Ark.: The New York Times reported in May that Cotton emerged as a possibility, citing sources who said Cotton’s relatively low profile and decade-plus experience in Congress and the Senate are attractive attributes to Trump, though Cotton has declined to weigh in on the prospect, telling ABC in early May “anyone out campaigning for the job or pushing for the job is not helpful to what we should all be focused on, which is winning the election.” Trump has selected his running mate and will announce his pick at the RNC just after 4:30 p.m. ET, multiple outlets reported, citing campaign sources familiar with Trump’s plans. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016. Several early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he’ll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a “solid” potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family’s “untrainable” and “dangerous” 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her “nasty and mean” goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told New York City-based News12 in May she would likely be “on our team in some form” if he’s elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unnamed sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis’ donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle. The 12th Amendment prohibits a state’s electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis, Rubio and other Florida-based contenders. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida’s 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin. Trump’s running mate could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio, DeSantis or anyone else who holds elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to The Miami Herald. Several of the candidates have clear downsides. Vance was critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump’s endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to “choose between him and the Constitution.” Trump has countered that Pence is “delusional.” Trump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties’ nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump’s nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as his running mate, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, The New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June “anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

Three police snipers were stationed inside the building and were tasked with looking out of the window at the rally, CBS News and local outlet Beaver Countian reported, citing local law enforcement sources. One of the law enforcement officers stationed in the building saw the gunman “scoping out” the roof and carrying a range finder, before briefly disappearing from the site and returning with a backpack, the reports said. The officer managed to take a photograph of the shooter and even radioed the sightings to his command center, but the suspected shooter—20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks—was reportedly able to scale the roof through an air conditioning unit. Local law enforcement officials cited by the reports blamed a lack of manpower—which prevented them from placing a sniper on the roof or providing the snipers on the ground with spotters—for their failure to stop Crooks, along with “extremely poor planning.” According to local TV station WPXI, officers on the ground first spotted Crooks nearly 30 minutes before he fired at Trump and the rally-goers. Some officers arrived at the building after the police sniper raised the alarm, tried to climb onto the roof and reach Crooks, but by that point he had fired his shot and been killed by the Secret Service.

On Saturday evening, Trump was addressing his supporters at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when Crooks fired at him. Several gunshots were heard and Trump ducked behind a podium before being quickly shielded by several Secret Service agents. As the agents tried to usher him off stage, Trump raised his fist at the crowd while his right ear appeared to be bloodied. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former local fire chief, was killed in the shooting while attempting to shield his family from the gunshots. Two other rally-goers, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured in the shooting and are hospitalized. Earlier on Monday, the FBI said it is still investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump and a potential domestic terrorist incident. The agency said its technical specialists have gained access to Crooks’ phone and are also analyzing his other electronic devices. According to CBS News, the FBI probe is attempting to establish if the shooter was “motivated by a violent extremist ideology or had any association with additional plotters or co-conspirators.” What We Know About The Attempted Assassination Of Donald Trump (Forbes) Suspected Trump Shooter Remembered By Rifle Team Member As ‘Comically Bad Shot’: What We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks (Forbes)\"}\n",

Drugmakers are vying for a slice of the growing weight loss drug market. Biotech Zealand Pharma is preparing to challenge Danish compatriot Novo on multiple fronts, including survodutide—an injectable it is jointly developing with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim that mimics the same GLP-1 gut hormone as Wegovy and Zepbound and another hormone called glucagon and has produced strong results in mid-stage clinical trials as both an anti-obesity drug and a treatment for fatty liver disease—and petrelintide, which mimics a different hunger regulating hormone, amylin, that CEO Adam Steensberg said could become “the backbone of therapy for weight management” after it showed promise in early clinical trials this June. San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics marked itself as a serious competitor in the weight loss drug market in February after revealing promising data from a mid-stage trial of experimental drug VK2735, which suggested it rivaled—and outperformed—Novo and Lilly drugs when given as a weekly injection and in March the company unveiled plans to test an oral tablet version after a small stage trial revealed weight loss as high as 3.3%. Terns Pharmaceuticals is developing an oral weight loss drug targeting the GLP-1 hormone and expects to release 28-day data on weight loss from an early stage trial in the second half of 2024. San Francisco startup Structure Therapeutics is also working on an oral, once-daily GLP-1 drug called GSBR-1290—the drug surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in June when a mid-stage study showed average weight loss of around 6% and it plans to start another mid-stage trial towards the end of this year—that founder and CEO Raymond Stevens says has the potential to become “a best-in-class” and makes an “an ideal backbone” for creating combination therapies to treat obesity and other conditions in the future. Maryland-based Altimmune in March touted promising mid-stage trial results for its injectable weight-loss drug pemvidutide—which is in the same class as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro—that stood out from the crowd by preserving lean muscle mass while still inducing weight loss, most of which came from fat, and CEO Vipin Garg told Reuters the firm is actively looking for a global partner to help with late state trials and launching the drug. U.S. pharma giant Pfizer scrapped two experimental weight loss pills last year—a once-daily pill, lotiglipron, due to elevated liver enzymes and a twice-daily pill, danuglipron, due to strong side effects—but CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is determined to “play and win” in the obesity space and in July the company said it is pushing ahead with a once-daily danuglipron pill following “encouraging” data from an ongoing early-stage trial. California biotech behemoth Amgen ditched plans for an experimental weight loss pill in May but is still hoping for a slice of the market with MariTide, a monthly injection that is taken less frequently than popular weekly treatments from Lilly and Novo and notably appears to help some patients maintain weight loss after they stop taking it, a key issue emerging for patients on current treatments. While semaglutide and tirzepatide—respectively the generic names for the active drug in Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—dominate the weight loss drug market (Mounjaro and Ozempic are only licensed for diabetes), neither Novo Nordisk nor Eli Lilly are resting on their laurels. Both are refining existing medications and developing next generation drugs to shore up their position in the future, as well as ramping up capacity to address persistent shortages amid booming demand. Novo, for example, is developing an oral version of semaglutide intended for once-daily treatment as well as new drugs like the injectable CagriSema, a combination drug that targets GLP-1 and another hormone, amylin, which regulates hunger. It is also developing amycretin in pill and injectable format, which is a single molecule targeting GLP-1 and amylin. Early data on the pill suggests amycretin could outperform Wegovy. Lilly, which secured approval for Zepbound in November, is working on a suite of new drugs including orforglipron and retatrutide, which hope to build on the weight loss in Zepbound and are both in late-stage trials. It is still going to be years before Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have serious competition for their popular weight loss treatment on pharmacy shelves. While the process varies, it can take between 10 and 20 years to usher a new drug through all three phases of clinical trials and most drugs ultimately fail during clinical testing. There is no guarantee promising results on efficacy, safety and tolerability from earlier trials will be replicated in larger late-stage trials. Even companies with candidates already in the later stages of testing are still going to require several years to gather and process the data and, should things pan out, time to work with regulators to secure approval. Launching the drug is another matter entirely and shoring up enough supplies has proven difficult even for companies the size of Lilly and Novo, who have continually failed to meet demand. Despite investing billions to ramp up production, both drugs are in short supply and both companies readily admit they are unlikely to meet demand in the near future. Bringing a drug to market is also a costly and logistically complex process, especially during the later stages of development and it is not uncommon for promising candidates, or even entire companies, to change hands. Pharma giants, who are increasingly replacing innovation with mergers and acquisitions, are known to scoop up promising drugs, portfolios or companies. Several have already happened in the weight loss space: Swiss heavyweight Roche inked a $2.7 billion deal for weight loss drug developer Carmot Therapeutics, whose once-weekly injection, CT-388, is in the same class as Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound and British giant AstraZeneca paid up to $2 billion for an experimental pill from Chinese firm Eccogene. Often, smaller companies will also seek partnerships or acquisition deals with larger pharma firms to help with the later stages of development for promising candidates. Altimmune’s Garg said the company is looking for partners for the later stages of development but would be open to considering deals with big pharma firms if they benefited shareholders. $100 billion. That’s how much the weight loss drug market will be worth by 2030, according to some analysts. Some think the market is potentially worth much more—some forecasts have grown to around $150 billion by the early 2030s—and both Novo and Lilly raked in billions from their GLP-1 drugs last year (which are also used to treat diabetes). There are now more than 50 weight loss drugs in various stages of clinical development from about 40 companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Analysts told Forbes Lilly and Novo are likely to continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Being first to market has given them a sizable first mover advantage and their sheer size will help consolidate their positions through the deals they make with pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. Both are also gathering data on how their anti-obesity drugs affect issues like cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, which could be used to help market the drug, including for other conditions in patients without obesity or diabetes, and secure further buy-in from governments and insurers who may have been unwilling to fund medication for what many still view as a lifestyle problem. Analysts told Forbes such data could be pivotal in securing the two companies’ position in the market and give them a powerful advantage over competitors entering with indications for weight loss alone. Novo secured such an advantage last week when the Food and Drug Administration authorized a label expansion for Wegovy to include cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Lilly is actively targeting sleep apnea as another condition tirzepatide can help with and if a label expansion is approved, the drug would become the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying causes of sleep apnea.

(Photo by Paula Bronstein/Getty Images) Leaders understand the importance of balancing professional responsibilities with personal well-being. This balance is essential not just for personal health, but also for fostering a motivated and productive workforce. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how vacations can significantly improve employee happiness and organizational success. The Impact of Taking Vacations Research has increasingly focused on the relationship between taking time off and its benefits for well-being. Vacations are crucial for mental, physical, and even spiritual health, and the advantages extend well beyond the duration of the break. Mind The cognitive impact of constant work pressure can be severe, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and impaired problem-solving abilities. Vacations provide the necessary respite, allowing for better sleep and mental clarity. A Stanford study highlighted that taking walks, even on a treadmill, can boost creativity. This demonstrates how mental breaks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and solutions. Body Chronic work stress elevates levels of cortisol and epinephrine, stress hormones that can suppress the immune system and increase susceptibility to illness. Vacations help reduce these stress hormones, enhancing immune function and overall physical health. Studies show that people who take regular vacations are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other stress-related conditions. Engaging in physical activities during vacations, such as hiking or swimming, further boosts health by improving cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Soul Vacations also impact us on a deeper, spiritual level by allowing us to reconnect with our true selves. Away from work pressures, we can reflect on our values and what truly brings us joy. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a stronger sense of purpose. When we return to work, we bring this renewed sense of self, which can improve our focus and engagement. Practical Implementation 1. Foster a Vacation-Friendly Culture: Encourage a workplace culture that values taking time off. Make it clear that vacations are not only acceptable but essential for maintaining high performance and well-being. 2. Promote Regular Breaks: Advocate for frequent, shorter breaks rather than just one long vacation. Regular mini-breaks can help maintain high levels of energy and creativity throughout the year. 3. Encourage Physical Activity: Suggest that employees engage in physical activities during their vacations. Activities like hiking, biking, or swimming can have long-lasting health benefits. 4. Support Work-Life Balance: Provide flexible work arrangements and ensure that employees take their vacation time. This can prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 5. Plan for Buffer Periods: Recommend that employees avoid packing their schedules immediately before and after vacations. Buffer periods can help maximize the restorative effects of their break. 6. Facilitate Mental Breaks: Encourage activities that promote mental relaxation, such as spending time in nature or pursuing hobbies. These activities can enhance cognitive function and creativity. 7. Highlight the Benefits of Unplugging: Emphasize the importance of truly disconnecting from work during vacations. This can significantly improve mental health and well-being. Understanding and promoting the benefits of vacations is crucial for leaders to foster a healthy, productive workforce. By encouraging regular breaks, physical activity, and true mental relaxation, leaders can help their teams recharge and return to work with renewed energy and creativity. Implementing these strategies improves employee satisfaction and contributes to the organization's overall success and sustainability.\"}\n",
      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/06/26/future-of-tv-business-television-showrunners-bear-season-three-christopher-storer/', 'title': 'Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television', 'date': 'Jun 26, 2024,06:00am EDT', 'author': 'Matt Craig', 'content': 'It wasn’t long ago that creating a hit show like The Bear was a TV writer’s ticket to lifelong financial security and, in a few rare cases, even a billion-dollar fortune. The half-hour drama, which returns to Hulu for its third season on Wednesday night, is everything a modern TV series aspires to be—an awards juggernaut, a ratings powerhouse and a cultural touchstone since its debut in June 2022. Even as recently as a decade ago, such success could have meant multiple 22-episode season orders and eventually a syndication deal that would produce a massive financial windfall for the studio, the showrunners and even the actors, who were traditionally given residuals for reruns and, in some instances, a slice of the profits. But in today’s TV and streaming landscape, profit participation is all but extinct, and in most cases so are the profits themselves. In 2023, labor strikes shut down television production for half the year, and in its wake the fear of another economic downturn has caused a significant contraction across the industry, with widespread budget cuts, layoffs, lowball offers and far fewer shows being ordered. With less money to go around, talent representatives and studio executives are left to argue over how to divide up the pieces of a rapidly diminishing pie. “What I keep saying to my partners on the studio side is, I hate the idea that my narrative of you is that all you do is cheat us and hide money and that\\'s who you are—for 50 years you\\'ve done nothing but cheat the talent,” says one lawyer who represents high-profile TV creators and actors. “The studio side narrative is, I can\\'t believe we ever cut these fucking people into our profits in the first place. They\\'re just talent and we put up all the money and how dare they.” With a hit show like The Bear, Forbes estimates that series creator Christopher Storer earns $5 million per year in an overall deal with FX, with his fees for writing, producing and directing counted against that total. Instead of owning a percentage of the series’ profits, which TV creators had traditionally maintained for decades, Storer and co-showrunner Joanna Calo are rewarded for their success through a bonus pool based on a set of achievements, including season renewals, award nominations and streaming service rankings. For Season 3 of The Bear—which swept the 2023 Emmy Awards, winning Best Comedy, Best Actor (for Jeremy Allen White) Best Supporting Actress (for Ayo Edebiri), Best Supporting Actor (for Eben Moss-Bacharach), as well as awards for Best Writing and Directing—Forbes projects those payouts will be a little more than $1 million for Storer and Calo. Combined, it’s enough to place them in the upper echelon of modern TV creators, but that’s less than one-tenth of what old guard showrunners like Dick Wolf (Law & Order), Greg Berlanti (CW’s Arrowverse), Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) make in a given year—with no visible path to eventually reach the economic stratosphere. Rerunning Low: \\'The Bear\\' will have produced 28 episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. Under the traditional TV syndication system, the potential existed for a hit series like Seinfeld or CSI to become its own cottage industry. Once a studio paid to produce the show, it would essentially rent it out to distributors—first a broadcast network, then cable channels, overseas markets and eventually streaming services—an infinite number of times. While most shows struggle to break even, a hit series would eventually reach profitability the longer it ran, and make astronomical profits in syndication. In that system, each party was incentivized to produce as many episodes as possible, and as contracts came up for renewal on long-running shows, showrunners and actors had considerable leverage to negotiate for higher fees and profit participation. The classic example is a show like Friends, which earned hundreds of millions each year, enough to make Warner Bros. Studios and NBC happy as well as the talent. Famously, in its third season, the six principal actors collectively negotiated to be paid equally for the duration of the show, earning $1 million per episode for the final two seasons as well as 2% of the show’s profits. In 2023, decades after Friends went off the air, Forbes estimates that Jennifer Aniston earned $17.5 million in residuals. That all changed with the rise of streaming. In the new landscape, a single company acts as the studio that pays to produce the show, the network where it first airs and the syndication network where its catalog can be replayed, meaning there are fewer ways to capitalize on a breakout hit. Revenue through subscriptions remains relatively flat while a show’s costs rise over time, disincentivizing more episodes and more seasons. The Bear, for all its buzz, will have produced 28 total episodes by the end of its third season, far short of the traditional 100-episode threshold for syndication. And because subscription revenue cannot be directly attributed to any one program, true profit participation for talent on either side of the camera is impossible to ask for. Still, creators and actors were lured to streamers like Netflix over the past decade because they offered high up-front fees plus an additional buyout of back-end participation, essentially paying for every show as if it were a modest success. And because streaming services weren’t restricted by a broadcast or cable channel playing one piece of content at a time, they churned through dozens of new shows each year in search of one or two that could break through the clutter. “The world is so much more fragmented now,” says Robert Fishman, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The definition of a hit is clearly different in today’s streaming world than it ever was in the traditional TV world, and that’s the reality of how the business operates today.” Meanwhile, streamers were building market share during a time when the only metric that mattered to Wall Street was subscriber growth. Cord cutting contributed to a steady decline in cable subscriber counts and broadcast TV ratings, especially among younger viewers. According to Nielsen, the median age of a primetime network viewer is now about 69 years old, a demographic that is less attractive to advertisers. As a result, fewer broadcast shows can reach profitability under the traditional economics. Hoping to find a middle ground, Disney unveiled a new compensation model for TV talent in 2021 called “Series Bonus Exhibit,” or SBE, which it applied to all new shows across its brands (ABC, Fox, FX, Disney+, and Hulu). For a show like The Bear, a pool of SBE points, usually 50, are divvied up among showrunners, producers, pilot directors and top actors. Each point pays out a set amount when certain conditions are met, such as a “Longevity Bonus” for season renewals—roughly $20,000 for Seasons 2 and 3, escalating to nearly $100,000 by Season 4—a “Current Series Ranking Bonus” for a show that reaches the top 10 or No. 1 on the corresponding streamer’s most-watched rankings, and a “Critical Acclaim Bonus” for Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. For Disney, SBE is a way to return to tying compensation to performance without having to calculate a show’s financial breakeven point, which often didn’t come until a seventh or eighth season and on several occasions led to intense legal battles and auditing to sort through profits owed to talent. In one instance, the actors and producers behind the Fox police procedural Bones took the network to court and landed a $179 million settlement. In practice, SBE pays less guaranteed money to a greater number of shows but eliminates the potential for so-called “home runs” that might have paid a showrunner who was entitled to profit participation hundreds of millions of dollars over dozens of years. For home run-hitting producers, there used to be a robust market for overall development deals to bridge the gap, such as the five-year, $300 million deal Netflix reportedly gave American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy in 2018. But agents and lawyers working in Hollywood today say that kind of deal is no longer on the table—even Murphy and Netflix split up last year at the end of the term. Today, the average overall deal for a successful first-time showrunner might be no more than $1.5 million per year. In recent months, Apple and Amazon, which have paid back-end buyouts for years, have been meeting with Hollywood talent representatives to present their versions of a bonus model for feedback. Amazon has been keen to highlight its potential for higher rewards in the case of a breakout series, while Apple includes new penalties for shows that go over budget. To talent representatives, it sounds a lot like television in a pre-streaming era. “Everybody in the room laughed,” says one top talent lawyer who heard the pitch. “Because that\\'s the exact opposite of what Amazon did 10 years ago when they said this [buyout system] is better for you because even though there’ll be no more home runs, so many more people will get singles and doubles.\" Adding to the sense of déjà vu all over again, Netflix and Amazon are beefing up their commercial offerings, even making presentations at this year’s Upfronts to woo advertisers to their platforms. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing some of its HBO shows to Netflix last year, a form of third-party syndication that was previously unthinkable. And Warner and Disney announced they would bundle their collective streaming services to form something resembling old school cable. Yet even if the future of television looks a lot like its past, it’s unlikely to create value for individual TV shows. On broadcast television, advertisers buy space during a specific program to reach that show’s audience, with rates varying based on ratings and demographics. That’s why commercials during the Super Bowl cost $7 million this year. Digital advertising, meanwhile, targets individual viewers algorithmically and charges a rate based on how many people view it. A company might buy advertising space on Netflix and never know what programs it runs alongside. While Netflix might care that a hit show increases subscriptions or engagement time on the platform, an advertising boom won’t suddenly increase the value of a single show. “Advertising on streaming isn’t intended to make money,” says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “Advertising is intended to broaden your reach and lower the price. You’re trying to make enough in ad revenue so that you’re indifferent whether someone has the ad supported or ad-free tier.” For actors today, earning seven figures per-episode remains the industry’s high watermark just as it was in the Friends era, despite twenty years of inflation and season orders decreasing from 22 episodes on network television to around 10 episodes per season on streaming. According to Forbes estimates, Bear star Jeremy Allen White will earn $750,000 per episode for the show’s third season, a significant raise from last year but as one veteran dealmaker put it, “if this was 2021, I would’ve expected it to be $1.2 million.” At the heart of the issue is the disconnect between commercial and artistic interests. The Bear—which chronicles a talented Chicago chef (White) and his ambitious protégé (Edebiri) as they attempt to transform a downscale family restaurant into a fine dining experience—is a remarkably modern TV creation, and it’s difficult to imagine a show this intense sustaining its energy through multiple 22-episode seasons. Even if that path were possible, it would likely be a far less attractive proposition for Storer and the cast, all of whom have become very in-demand since the show debuted in 2022. Reports claim the show filmed additional episodes in Chicago this spring, leading many to speculate that its fourth season could be its last. “Unfortunately in the arms race of streaming, people forgot that historically television has been a B to B+ content model for stickiness to sell ads,” says the same dealmaker. “As compared to making A+ 10-part movies that would then become something that everybody has to see and spend $10 million per episode on, the model just doesn\\'t really work for that.\"'}\n",

(Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Country singer Ingrid Andress sang the national anthem at the Home Run Derby on July 15. Unfortunately, her performance, which kicked off the popular MLB event, quickly went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. The four-time Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter delivered the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2024 Home Run Derby held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. As she missed several notes, viewers and sports commentators took to social media to weigh in on the rocky performance. “The national anthem ahead of the 2024 Home Run Derby on ESPN by four-time Grammy-nominated artist Ingrid Andress was interesting, to say the least...,” the account Awful Announcing penned on X. “It is impressive that this Ingrid Andress has missed every single note. That was painful #HomeRunDerby,” added another X user. “I’m so sorry, I’m sure Ingrid Andress is a wonderful person, but that was one of the worst national anthems I think I’ve ever heard in my whole life,” wrote Sports Illustrated writer and podcast host Alex Carr. The camera then panned to some players, including participant Alec Bohm of the Philadelphia Phillies, who was trying to contain his laughter. Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Fergie’s infamous live version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. “With all due respect to Ms. Andress, who is wonderfully talented and surely a delightful country singer, her rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ was not good. I’m sorry, but it wasn’t. We’re all thinking it and it has to be said,” wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.

[+] at Olympiastadion on July 14, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Dan Mullan/Getty Images) In a tournament where many of the top sides struggled with disjointed displays, Spain won Euro 2024 by playing incisive attacking soccer. Spain not only won Euro 2024, but they did it the hard way, winning every single game, and beating Croatia, Italy, Germany, France and England. The 15 goals scored by Spain is more than any other team has scored in any other European Championship. La Roja might contain one of the next superstars in 17-year-old wonderkid Lamine Yamal, but overall, it isn’t a team of big-name players. Spain won the tournament not necessarily because they had the best players, but because they had the best team. And the foundations of that team were put in place by head coach Luis de la Fuente at youth level, at the 2019 Under-21 Championships in Italy, and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. On 61 minutes in the Olympics gold medal match against Brazil in Yokohama, Mikel Oyarzabal arrived at the far post to volley in an equalizer for Spain. Brazil would go on to win that game 2-1 in extra time. But three years later Oyarzabal would once again score for Spain in a final. This time, the Real Sociedad forward perfectly timed his run and knocked the ball past England’s Jordan Pickford in the 86th minute at Euro 2024 in Berlin to win the trophy for Spain. Spain’s starting eleven in Berlin contained three members of that Olympic squad: goalkeeper Unai Simon, defender Marc Cucurella, and midfielder Dani Olmo, whose header off the line prevented England’s Marc Guehi from getting a last-gasp equalizer.

(Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images) Three other members of Spain’s Euro 2024 squad went to Tokyo, including Barcelona midfielder Pedri, who played 73 games in the 2020/21 season that ended with that Olympic final in Tokyo. Pedri was a key part of the Spain side this summer before his injury in the quarterfinal against Germany. Others like midfielders Rodri and Fabian Ruiz who weren’t part of that Olympic team played under de la Fuente at youth level. Rodri, whose performances this year make him a potential Ballon d’Or candidate, has said this Spanish group “had done good things together at youth level” and that he was convinced that with time and effort, they would get things right. Rodri has been the metronome keeping this Spanish team beating as one, but when he went off injured at half-time in the final against England, Martin Zubimendi, another member of that 2020 Olympics team, slotted into his role effortlessly. In international soccer, head coaches spend very little time with their players, and with travel and conditioning programs eating into that time, they have very few training sessions to get to know their players and put their ideas into practice. Spain’s squad at the 2020 Olympics contained six players who were at the 2020 European Championships earlier that summer, including Oyarzabal and Olmo. While playing in the Olympics straight after the Euros must have been exhausting for the players, it meant de la Fuente had a chance to coach them on the biggest stage possible outside of senior-level soccer. All that extra time that de la Fuente spent with the players at the Olympics and at youth level meant he understands his players’ strengths and weaknesses better. It also allows Spain to play more of a team than as a group of individuals. In terms of club soccer, it can take longer than a year to build optimum levels of cohesion and understanding between players. It is almost impossible to do that in a couple of international breaks, but being able to build some of that cohesion at youth level, and at the stepping stone level between youth and senior soccer that the Olympics occupies, can make the job a bit easier. The Olympics is often seen as a distant second to the World Cup and continental championships, but nations that take it seriously can reap the benefits. The prospect of winning an Olympic medal adds an extra level of competitiveness and pressure that other youth tournaments can’t replicate. Spain’s squad for the Paris 2024 Olympics, though not as strong as the team taken to Tokyo, still includes senior internationals Abel Ruiz and Eric Garcia as they look for back-to-back Olympic medals. But Paris could also be a success if it helps Spain win the 2026 World Cup or the European Championship in 2028. Those players in Paris will be building up connections and knowledge of their teammates’ play that could help build the spine Spain’s senior side in the future.\"}\n",

Cha Seung-won, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo Yeon-su joined director Park Hoon-jung at a press conference this week in Seoul. The team assembled to promote their new drama The Tyrant, a Disney+ drama that will air on Aug. 14. The drama was originally planned to be a film . The director is known for the universe he created with previous films New World and The Witch series, but something about this story seemed to better suit a four-part series. “It was my very first time to work on a series,” said Park. “And it was very difficult, maybe because it was my first time. I have a lot of respect for the creators who create series.” The characters played by Cha, Kim Seon-ho, Kim Kang-woo and Jo spend plenty of time clashing in this drama. The clashes begin when a U.S. intelligence agency discovers a secret initiative called The Tyrant Project, a Korean government project to develop a bioweapon that can enhance human abilities. U.S. agencies ask for the project to be terminated and request all samples. Director Choi, played by Kim Seon-ho, instructs his staff to secure the bioweapon, while Paul, a U.S. agent, played by Kim Kang-woo, tries to get and dispose of the last sample. Cha plays Lim Sang-won, a former agent, who is hired to eliminate people. Cha previously worked with the director on the film Night In Paradise. Cha Seung-won plays a former agent in 'The Tyrant.' “I'm a big fan of his,” said Cha. “This is my second collaboration with him and the biggest charm of his movies and shows is that when we're doing these genre shows, you should always be confident and you should just go with what you believe in. And I think that's exactly what we do in the show. The characters all have confidence in what they do, so they don't hesitate at all. And I was very curious how he's going to bring all of this confidence on screen. And I think that's how I started becoming very curious about the script.” Kim Seon-ho is a big fan of the director‘s Witch franchise, which Park says shares the same universe. “I worked on The Childe with Director Park,” said Kim Seon-ho. “I love his films and when I saw the script, I felt like these four people are all just dashing and they're all trains with broken brakes. So I really loved that tension. It was such a thrilling ride for me.” “Seon-ho shared with me that he thought it was a very intriguing character to play,” said Park. “But he had some concerns because he had never done something like that before. I had complete confidence in him that he would do very well. I told him, just do it. Just do it.” Kim Kang-woo plays a Korean American intelligence agent in 'The Tyrant.' Kim Kang-woo also worked with the director in The Childe. In The Tyrant his character Paul is part of a U.S. overseas intelligence unit. He learns about the project and comes to Korea undercover to end it. Kim Kang-woo and the director had many discussions about the character. “When I saw him take on the role of Paul in front of the camera,” said Park. “He was so well prepared and so detailed to the point where I hadn't even expected that. When you see him on screen, you will be able to tell exactly the type of person he's trying to portray.” The Korean American character is described as relentless and cold-blooded, but he’s complicated. “Because this person was American, I had to really practice a lot of English dialogue as well,” said Kim Kang-woo. “So that was quite a challenge.” Jo Yeon-su plays an operative with special skills in 'The Tyrant.' Cha, Kim Seon-ho and Kim Kang-woo have worked with the director before but the fourth cast member, actress Jo Yeon-su, had not. “When you look at the storyline, this is a character whose name is very well known in this space,” said Park. “But she’s someone who is sort of a veiled mystery. In order to capture that, I thought that the actor who played the role should also be like that. We met with many potential candidates and I think you will all be convinced when you watch the series that it was a perfect casting choice.” Jo plays Ja-kyung, a technician asked by Director Choi to steal the last sample of The Tyrant Project. Park and her fellow actors praised the rookie actress for the work she put into the role. According to Park, Jo’s fist fighting skills exceed those of any actor he’s worked with. The actress spent a month and a half training before the shoot and continued to train during production. “I would go to stunt training to make sure that I was prepared for the scenes,” said Jo. “At first bringing up my stamina was really important. Then I learned about the choreography of the actions and how I could use these knives and firearms as well.” “She didn't even need a stunt double for fist fights,” said Park. “She is just amazing with her punches.” When asked to describe the upcoming adrenaline-infused series, Park said, “This is just a very entertaining show. It's going to be a fun, thrilling ride for all the audiences.” The drama airs internationally on Disney+ and on Hulu in the U.S.\"}\n",

Boeing is bringing production of its plane fuselages back in-house. The aerospace giant announced early Monday it had agreed to acquire its largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, in an $8.3 billion deal, including debt, 19 years after it had spun out the operation. It may be the best of bad options for the embattled companies, industry experts told Forbes, but it will take Boeing years to straighten out the money-losing supplier and the quality problems that have bedeviled both of them. “This is a lot like two drunk guys at a bar saying I'm too drunk to drive home,” said Cliff Collier, an aerospace consultant. “And then one of them says, ‘I know, we'll get in the same car and go together.’ This is not going to solve either company's problems.” Improving Spirit operations and integrating them with Boeing’s will be complicated, and Boeing executives have to do so while absorbed with a host of other problems. Chief among them is manufacturing quality: In January, a panel made by Spirit blew out of a Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska airlines mid-flight, prompting scrutiny by regulators. A federal investigation into the accident preliminarily found that the panel had been removed at a Boeing factory to fix rivets that had been misinstalled by Spirit workers, and then put back in place without four retaining bolts. It’s unclear that Boeing’s current management has a solid grip on how to improve quality, some say. “It's not like Boeing has a world-class operating system that they can just drop in on Spirit. Boeing's operating system has the same problem Spirit’s does,” said Collier. CEO David Calhoun touted the deal Monday as “one of the most significant” the company has taken to strengthen quality. “This is an opportunity to bring back critical airplane manufacturing work on Boeing airplanes into our factories – where Boeing and Spirit world-class engineers and mechanics can work seamlessly together, focused on a common mission to build safe and quality airplanes for our customers.” In 2005, as part of a campaign to outsource parts production for its planes, Boeing sold off to private equity the factory in Wichita, Kansas, that built the fuselages for the 737, its best-selling plane, as well as body parts of other aircraft. Spirit expanded to make structures for other companies, most notably Airbus, but it struggled to build a sustainable business. Most aerospace suppliers make fat profits from selling spare parts for repairs, something that isn’t a possibility with fuselages because they’re expected to last the life of the aircraft. Spirit’s financial position worsened when Boeing halted production of the 737 Max in January 2020 after two deadly crashes in the previous two years. Then the Covid pandemic froze aircraft demand more broadly. But Spirit has had to carry the expense of maintaining capacity for higher production rates than Boeing could take. By 2023, Boeing was forced to inject cash into Spirit to keep it afloat. As part of the deal, Airbus will also be paid $559 million to take over unprofitable units of Spirit that make parts for the European planemaker. There may be some cost savings from combining the two companies. If Spirit were producing at a full rate of 50 737 fuselages a month, instead of around 30 now, it could earn a profit of roughly $1.5 million on each, Melius Research estimates. Eliminating that markup would save Boeing $900 million a year. But it will be hard to find synergies in their supply chains, said Collier. And it will take time for Boeing to switch Spirit over to its systems for managing day-to-day operations and HR. Meanwhile Spirit machinists’ collective bargaining agreement, which is based on Spirit’s current operating methods and runs until June 2027, will make it harder for Boeing to harmonize how their factories run. “To some degree Boeing's going to have to be hands off for a couple years because it's too hard to try to integrate them right now,” said Collier. “But then you ask yourself, okay, then how's Boeing fixing Spirit?” Green Workers, Red Ink One of the key problems at Spirit, Boeing and the broader aerospace sector, observers say, is a deep loss of experience on the assembly line during the pandemic, when companies shed tens of thousands of workers amid a deep freeze in aviation. Amid a strong rebound in the manufacturing job market nationwide, aerospace companies only got 20% to 30% of furloughed workers to come back, analyst Scott Mikus of Melius Research estimates, compared to 70% to 80% in prior downturns. Boeing has expanded its training for new employees, but even the best training is only the start in building airplanes, said Collier. The production rates of planes are low compared to cell phones or cars, so aerospace assembly workers aren’t doing the same repetitive tasks many times a day like their compatriots at higher-volume manufacturers, he said, and tend to perform a broader range of work with more tools. “It still takes a couple of years to really get good at assembly in aerospace, no matter what you do [in initial training],” Collier said. Experience is particularly important on the 737 Max, the latest version of a plane that debuted in the 1960s. It’s largely handmade, with Spirit and Boeing workers manually drilling and filling hundreds of thousands of holes. Misdrilled holes have been flagged on more 737 Max planes than just the Alaska model. Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan has touted adding more automation on the assembly line as the key. “That is the fundamental solution to zero defects,” he said on an earnings call in February. Automation will help to an extent, but it will take time and only go so far, observers say. “It’ll be a multi-year thing” to get the machines from manufacturers and integrate them into Spirit’s operations, said Mikus. The antiquated nature of the 737 will limit how much of the work can be turned over to industrial robots, said Collier. “You're probably doing good to get 60% automated. So you’ve still got to drill tens of thousands of holes.” Boeing will now also be saddled with supporting Spirit’s suppliers, who are also struggling after investing to raise production rates at Boeing’s behest, only to be stuck with idle capacity as the plane maker has struggled to follow through on its plans. “If they could turn on the Max machine and get to [40 or 50 planes per month], none of these cash issues would be a problem,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. “It's just a giant self-inflicted wound.” Boeing has a slate of its own problems. Its board is searching for a new CEO to replace Calhoun, who has pledged to exit by the end of the year. (Spirit CEO Shanahan, who used to work at Boeing, is believed to be a candidate.) The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly set to bring fraud charges against the company after determining it violated the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement over the two Max crashes. And the union that represents its assembly workers in Washington State has scheduled a vote for next month to authorize leadership to call a strike amid negotiations for a new contract. (If Boeing’s machinists in Washington state win a fat contract, that could spark discontent among Spirit workers over the terms of their deal, points out Collier.) At Spirit, separating the operations that Airbus will take over is a complicated headache of its own. Meanwhile, Spirit has built up a defense business that makes structures for Boeing competitors – most notably the fuselage of the in-development B-21 bomber for Northrop Grumman. It’s possible that defense companies will have concerns about Boeing gaining access to their intellectual property, said Mikus. However, Aboulafia said a change in leadership to executives focused more on manufacturing than financial results could go a long way to helping Boeing solve its problems. The C-suite failures at Boeing “paradoxically fills me with hope,” he said. “If you have leaders that show up in factories and are engaged in the actual business of building and designing planes, it can get much better very fast.”\"}\n",

But extracting and processing the critical mineral is both costly and tough on the environment – and the United States largely relies on China for its supply. “The demand side of lithium is crazy,” said Prakash Govindan, the cofounder and chief operating officer of wastewater startup Gradiant. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business, but it is in the early stages of revenue.” To meet that demand, Gradiant, which cleans up wastewater on an industrial scale, is spinning out a new business, called alkaLi. Instead of mining from rock, the standalone venture plans to extract lithium from brine – naturally occurring extremely salty water found in a variety of regions – and process it for use in batteries using a technique that it developed. It expects to raise $15 to $20 million, including from Gradiant itself, which will maintain a stake in the business, and to ultimately hire a new CEO to run it, Govindan said. “We believe we can create a billion-dollar company just from the lithium business.” The new business in lithium is an offshoot of Gradiant’s core operations in industrial wastewater treatment, where it works with major customers that include semiconductor giants TSMC and Micron, pharmaceutical makers Pfizer and GSK, Coca-Cola and mining firm Rio Tinto. The firm, which has raised more than $400 million, including from billionaire John Arnold’s Centaurus Capital, reached a $1 billion valuation last year, the rare water-technology startup to hit that mark. Gradiant’s revenue reached $150 million last year, and it’s expected to hit $350 million this year. The lithium business currently has four commercial customers and represents “less than 10%” of Gradiant’s revenue, Govindan said. Govindan, 40, and Anurag Bajpayee, 39 and the company’s CEO, started the company in 2012 based on water purification research they’d done as Ph.D. students at MIT. Today, the company has more than 1,000 installations for water treatment, removal of “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, and lithium extraction. Gradiant developed the lithium technology in partnership with oilfield services giant SLB, which is both an investor and a customer. SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) set up its technology at a pilot project in Nevada in 2023. The process uses resins and membranes to more easily extract the lithium from brine, then relies on its own technology to concentrate the mineral, which ultimately is precipitated into a solid for use in batteries. (This is a similar process to making rock candy from sugar water, although with many more complicated steps.) “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China.” The company said that its process for extracting lithium is faster and better for the environment, with both reduced carbon and water impact, compared to traditional methods of mining. It also has 50% lower operating costs than other methods of getting lithium from brine, Govindan said, which typically relies on evaporation ponds to slowly allow the lithium to become concentrated. “Mining is a very important application in general for Gradiant, but lithium is special,” Govindan said. “We are experts in concentrating and converting the lithium-rich brine into lithium carbonate.” One advantage over the long term could be less reliance on China for the critical mineral. “In my opinion, the United States can produce all the lithium that it needs itself and be independent of China,” said Ashok Belani, who worked with Gradiant on the project as SLB’s executive vice president of new energy and then was SLB’s senior strategic advisor before retiring from the firm in March. But, he said, it could take a decade to get 10 projects producing 10,000 tons a year of lithium off the ground, as major industrial projects like this can take five or six years each to go through development. “It is a big deal,” he said. “If it is doable, then the world doesn’t have a lithium problem.” Global lithium consumption reached 134,000 tons in 2022, a 41% increase from 95,0000 tons in 2021, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. While lithium prices have plunged over the past year, in part due to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales in China, long-term demand is expected to rise. By 2030, more than 60% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be plug-ins or hybrids, according to data from the public-private partnership Li-Bridge. Starting the business while prices are depressed may seem counterintuitive, but it offers an advantage, Govindan said. “There are products being prepared in expectation of an increased price, there is demand for the technology, and it’s hard to introduce at the peak of prices when there is a gold rush.”'}\n",

The moment that many Real Madrid fans have been waiting for over several years finally arrived as Kylian Mbappé was officially presented as a new player for Los Blancos on Tuesday. The forward underwent medical checks and signed his contract at the club’s training ground in Valdebebas before heading to the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu to meet the fans waiting for him. Standing on a stage alongside club president Florentino Pérez and all 15 of Real Madrid’s Champions League trophies, Mbappé received a raucous reception from his new fans, who were present in huge numbers. Also present were several iconic figures from the club’s history, including fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. ‘12 years ago, Zizou invited a boy to our training ground, and he is now the star who will help us to succeed in the future, today we welcome Kylian Mbappé,’ Pérez said to introduce the player. ‘Welcome to your home, and congratulations for achieving your dream. I know what this means to you and your family. We saw how your eyes shone when you came here at the age of 13.’ Mbappé emerged onto the stage in full kit and declared, ‘hello everyone, I’m going to try to speak in Spanish. Wow, it’s incredible to be here. I’ve dreamt about this for many years, I’m a very happy boy today.’ The club opened up their online ticketing portal for members to register to attend the presentation, and the 80,000 capacity was snapped up in minutes despite the timing being at 12pm on a Tuesday. There had been hopes for an evening presentation, but commitments to prepare the stadium for an upcoming concert meant that it was brought forward. Real Madrid have been keen to cash in on the pull of their new superstar signing, and have been blown away by the number of fans looking to buy a jersey featuring the number nine which Mbappé will wear. Set at a price tag of €170 ($185), fans buying the jersey from the club’s official website have been warned that delivery may take up to six weeks due to the high demand. Mbappé wore the jersey and a full kit as he was presented, with queues outside the club store from early in the morning on the day of his presentation. This was the first time that Mbappé could be pictured in a white Real Madrid jersey since he joined the club earlier this summer. The new arrival delayed his summer vacation in order to come to the Spanish capital for his presentation, having been eliminated from Euro 2024 with France against eventual victors Spain last Tuesday. As such, he will now start a delayed vacation period to rest before joining his team-mates. That means that he will not be ready to join his new team for their US tour, which will depart later this month ahead of exhibition matches in Chicago, New Jersey and Charlotte. He will begin training around August 6th in Madrid, in order to pass the necessary medical checks to be available for training with his new colleagues upon their return from the US. With those dates in mind, a target debut could be the UEFA European Super Cup clash with Italian side Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland, on August 14th. It will be up to Carlo Ancelotti whether he thinks Mbappé is fit enough to start, and if he is left on the bench he could wait for a debut in La Liga against Mallorca on August 18th, and a home debut will follow against Real Valladolid on August 25th.'}\n",

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) If matters don’t drastically improve following the All Star break, Toronto Blue Jays players will be heading for the golf course during Major League Baseball’s postseason play Some Blue Jays front office administrators may be looking for new employment. With a record of 44-52, the Blue Jays entered the All Star break last in the American League East. First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the only Blue Jays representative on the 2024 American League All Star team. Following a slow start, Guerrero has shown improvement in his offensive production. Outfielder George Springer, and shortstop Bo Bichette have struggled to find consistency at the plate. Lately, Springer’s production has been somewhat improved. Bichette, however, has battled right calf injuries, and continues to be mired in a season-long hitting slump. It seems likely the Blue Jays will try to shake up their roster and change the current losing culture of the club. The MLB trade deadline is July 30. Always regarded by analysts to be a competitive team, the Blue Jays have not won a postseason playoff series since 1993; when they won the World Series in six games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Since the World Series victory 31 years ago, here is the Blue Jays postseason record: 2015- lost the American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals 2016- lost the American League Championship Series to the Cleveland Indians 2020- (pandemic shortened season)-lost the American League Wild Card to the Tampa Bay Rays 2022- lost the American League Wild Card to the Seattle Mariners 2023- lost the American League Wild Card to the Minnesota Twins Yes, every year, the American League East is probably the toughest division in baseball. The Blue Jays have always seemed to field a roster of highly regarded hitters and pitchers. And yet, here they are. Losing again. According to sportrac.com, the Blue Jays rank 9th among the 30 MLB clubs in Tax Payroll. The team’s payroll sits at $245,739,710. If the Blue Jays hope to claw their way back in the race, they will likely have to trade Guerrero Jr., or a starting pitcher. Guerrero Jr. is clearly the team’s best trade chip. However, he is also the best hope for a revived second half offense. Bo Bichette’s injury status and his massive offensive decline has softened his trade value. Pitching is in tremendous demand in MLB, and the Blue Jays may be tempted to reshape their roster with young, controllable prospects. Given the fact Guerrero Jr. is still the best hitter on the club, it seems more likely the team will look to trade from among these starting pitchers: Jose Berrios-RHP-Age 30 Yusei Kikuchi-LHP-Age 33 Chris Bassitt-RHP-Age 35 Kevin Gausman-RHP-Age 33 Yariel Rodriguez-RHP-Age 27 Frankly, this old scout wouldn’t remove any of the pitchers above from trade consideration. Each has value. Some more than others. Each can fetch a good return. Some a better return than others. TORONTO, ON - JULY 2: Jose Berrios #17 of Toronto Blue Jays walks to the dugout ahead of playing the ... [+] Houston Astros in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on July 2, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) He has a seven-year, $131 million contract he signed in 2022. The average annual value is $18,714,286. Many contending teams can afford a top pitcher at that price. This season, Berrios has a record of 8-7, in 20 starts, covering 119 innings. He has thrown to a 4.01 ERA, with a 1.18 WHIP. Berrios has struck out an average of 6.6 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.5. He has yielded 21 runs, which is a bit alarming. Assessment: Attractive trade option for a contender willing to pay the salary and top prospect prices.

Kikuchi strikes out an average of 9.9 hitters per nine innings, while walking 2.2 per nine. He has yielded 16 home runs. He is in the final year of his contract. He will have to be paid the remainder of $10 million, which is a bargain. He is a pending free agent. Assessment: He could be in high demand at a fairly low salary and prospect cost.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/06/28/airline-miles-hotel-points-hacking/', 'title': 'Hackers Are Now Coming For Your Airline Miles And Hotel Points', 'date': 'Jun 28, 2024,06:30am EDT', 'author': 'Jeremy Bogaisky', 'content': \"Most people don’t check their hotel or airline points accounts very often. That makes them a fat target for thieves. Security experts say there’s been a surge in hacking of hotel and airline loyalty accounts over the past year, driven by two factors: Better protections against credit card fraud means criminals are looking for easier targets, and cybercrime rings have been selling tools to carry out attacks, enabling people without coding skills to break into accounts. The shift from credit card fraud to loyalty account takeovers has caught airlines “flat-footed,” said Christopher Staab, cofounder of the Loyalty Security Alliance, a travel industry group. “They don't have the tools, the processes, the people that understand this.” Airlines held initial meetings this week of a new working group to coordinate a response, he said. With billions of dollars in points flowing in and out of mileage programs every year, “they're essentially like bank accounts,” said Nik Laming, a Singapore-based loyalty program consultant to airlines and retailers. But loyalty programs “aren't compelled to protect these accounts like a bank.” Loyalty accounts have been hacked in lower volumes for years through techniques like phishing and malware that steals passwords. But now, cybercriminals are taking databases of login credentials exposed in website breaches and using bots to test them en masse on airline and hotel loyalty accounts. They’re taking advantage of one of the most common security mistakes people make online: using the same password in multiple places, said Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, which protects companies against online fraud. Between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, bot attacks on airline accounts Arkose protects increased 166%, the company said. The San Mateo, California-based company’s customers include Singapore Airlines and Japanese discount carrier Zipair, as well as other airlines it said it can’t disclose. (The two airlines did not respond to a comment request.) There’s been a 30% to 40% increase in accounts successfully hacked, Staab estimates, based on discussions with members of his industry group. Tools to carry out so-called credential-stuffing attacks are being sold by bad actors in Vietnam, China and Russia, said Gosschalk, and they’re offering tech support for buyers. “You don’t need to be a developer anymore,” said Gosschalk. “The accessibility to commit the crime has come way down thanks to this infrastructure now being available to make these attacks.” Cybercriminals using those tools are selling access to accounts they’ve compromised, often through Telegram and WhatsApp groups, with the number of points listed. Accounts are often priced at 80% of the value of the points or less, said Gosschalk. Some offer guarantees that the buyer will have access for a minimum number of minutes. If account security boots them out before then, they’ll get a similar value substitute or their money back. In this screenshot of a post on Telegram, airline and hotel points accounts are offered for sale. The buyers cash out by redeeming the points as gift cards or by purchasing airline tickets. Some of the hacked accounts are used to sell steeply discounted airline tickets to the public on websites that look legitimate travel agencies, said Staab. Roughly 1% of airline points redemptions are fraudulent, Staab estimates, with total losses amounting to about 3% when associated costs are included, including staff time and refunding of points to some customers. The International Airline Transport Association estimated in 2020 that the industry lost upward of $1 billion a year to payment fraud. Staab thinks the total volume of fraud hasn’t risen, but has shifted from credit card fraud to account takeovers. Loyalty accounts have become more valuable targets thanks to airlines’ success hawking co-branded credit cards that give customers air miles as a reward for using them. The leader has been Delta Air Lines, which should earn about $7 billion from its American Express card partnership this year, according to analysts at TD Cowen, up from $1 billion in 2009. Delta has 25 million active SkyMiles members. A spokesperson for Delta, Drake Castaneda, said he wasn’t aware of an uptick in hacked rewards accounts. Roughly 70% of points earned by customers of Delta, American and United airlines now come from rewards from credit cards and other partners, according to a report from IdeaWorks. Hotel chains have also jumped on the credit card train. But airlines’ security measures haven’t kept up: Most hotel and airline chains don’t require multi-factor authentication because they’re loath to add friction to the transaction process for customers, Laming said. That makes these accounts an easier target. Compared to hacking a bank account, there’s also a much lower risk of criminal charges, Staab said. One reason: it’s more difficult for prosecutors to connect large numbers of hacks to a single suspect, necessary to show a high enough dollar value loss to justify spending time on the case. In a rare prosecution, in 2021, five men pled guilty in federal court in Texas to fraud charges over the theft of millions of airline miles from hacked accounts and the sale of tickets purchased with them. In this screenshot from a website that has been taken down, Delta SkyMiles are offered for sale with a replacement guarantee. This type of hacking can be a launchpad to more serious crimes, said Gosschalk. Arkose has tracked some hackers who got started in their teens taking over video game accounts to steal virtual currency, and then used the skills they developed to go after hotel and airline accounts. “It's a bit of a gateway drug in the sense that it's a pretty easy crime to do,” said Gosschalk. Hackers can move on to money laundering, ransomware and credential-stuffing attacks on bank accounts. Three hotel chains and four airlines contacted by Forbes declined to say whether they were experiencing an increase in hacking of loyalty accounts. But behind the scenes, Staab said there has been rising concern. Many hotels and airlines are biting the bullet and moving to require some form of multifactor authentication – for instance, in the case of redemptions of points above a certain value, Staab said. United Airlines’ online security chief, Deneen DeFiore, said in a presentation at a conference last month that the airline was moving away from security questions, which, like passwords, have been leaked and are often reused, and is looking at new forms of account authentication entirely, according to Gosschalk. DeFiore and United did not respond to questions from Forbes. There are also AI-enabled tools coming into use that can detect anomalies and patterns in transactions and trigger alerts, said Laming. Ultimately, educating people to stop recycling their passwords would have the greatest impact, he said. “You can put all the controls you want in place, but if the member is using the same credentials … then it makes it very hard for you to combat it.”\"}\n",

In its fifth year, the NBA Academy Games is an annual showcase that brings together top international prospects to compete against their peers from around the world in front of NCAA college coaches and NBA scouts. The event, which has become a staple in the July basketball circuit in Georgia, typically includes teams representing the different NBA Academies around the world, in addition to a select team of international prospects who are not enrolled in an NBA Academy program but are among the top player high school-age players in the world. The 2024 version of the NBA Academy Games have officially concluded, with the world getting a look at which players could be cracking the NBA doors open in a few years. Among them were two players from Denmark, a country that remains without NBA representation since Gabriel \"Iffe\" Lundberg played with the Phoenix Suns in 2022. Frederik Drejer Erichsen, a 6\\'9 floor leader who will be draft eligible, is the nephew of Christian Drejer, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. The playmaker is savvy, poised, and will be draft eligible in 2025, the same calendar year he turns 19 years old. Andreas Holst, an athletic 7-footer with wing skills, and a strong willingness to take three-pointers, offers an intriguing package of inside/outside potential. He was draft eligible this year, but has decided to wait for when the timing is right. Both players were included on the select team. The duo spent last year under the umbrella of Bakken Bears, the biggest club in Denmark, which also saw a third player - Gustav Knudsen - enter his name into this year\\'s draft. Outside of the aforementioned trio, Danish Marqus Marion, Johan Munch, and Tobias Jensen are also making waves as players that will bring Denmark into the future of international basketball. Erichsen, speaking after the NBA Academy event, describes being the nephew of a draftee as an \"advantage\", outlining the benefits of having a famous uncle. \"It\\'s 100% helped me to have someone in the family who can help me with [the journey]. He\\'s already been in the game, so he knows what\\'s going on, he can help me take the extra step, and he\\'s got connections\", he tells me. Erichsen averaged 22 minutes at the Academy Games, scoring 9.2 points, grabbing 4.3 rebounds, and dishing two assists per outing. His big frame, combined with strong on-ball skills, seem tailor made for the NBA, particularly if the three-point shot becomes a truly reliable weapon for him moving forward. Holst, who notched 6.8 points in 20 minutes, also grabbed 3.0 rebounds, and took a whopping 26 three-point shots in 118 total minutes, canning 34.6% of them, and further showcasing his ability to become a big man spacer, which is still en vogue in the NBA. While both youngsters are still improving, their respective skill sets align strongly with where the NBA is headed, where flexibility, positional fluidity, and perimeter skill is all the rage. That may not guarantee either a selection in the draft next year, but it certainly doesn\\'t hurt their chances. Another year of development, and deep focus, might push them over the top. Danish basketball players, not to mention an increasing fan base, are hoping the academy games will serve as a start for larger Danish representation, which will eventually lead to Danes occupying the NBA court on permanent basis. As for Lundberg, 29, who signed a two-year contract with Serbian Partizan this summer, he too remains on the NBA radar. He rejected a contract offer from the Boston Celtics this summer, due to the lack of guarantee of playing time, opting instead to become a major puzzle piece in Belgrade. Lundberg\\'s two-year contract has an NBA-out clause after the first season, meaning he\\'s allowed to receive offers next summer from teams in the association. Compared to where Danish basketball was just five years ago, the talent has taken a massive leap, and now thousands of Danish fingers are crossed, hoping that the hard work pays off.'}\n",

May 1Fifteen people were arrested and charged with trespassing at Fordham University’s encampment, the college’s president Tania Tetlow confirmed in a letter obtained by NBC New York, which was set up only hours after the other New York City college encampments were destroyed. May 1Thirty-four protesters were arrested at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but protesters quickly erected a new encampment the same day, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. May 1At least 17 people were arrested at the University of Texas-Dallas after police moved to dismantle a protest encampment, the Dallas Morning News reported. May 1Fourteen people were arrested at Tulane’s campus encampment in New Orleans early Wednesday morning, including two students, the student newspaper The Tulane Hullabaloo reported, after the university declared the encampment an “unlawful occupation.” May 1Four people were arrested at the University of Arizona’s encampment in Tucson, including one who was charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” the university confirmed, after police dispersed a crowd of more than 100 using tear gas and rubber bullets, the Arizona Republic reported. April 30Thirty-five people were arrested at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt in northern California, the university confirmed, after protesters occupied two campus buildings. April 30Police detained 36 people at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill encampment, student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel reported, but only six were charged and jailed for trespassing.

April 30Another 173 people were arrested at City University of New York’s campus in Harlem the same night. April 30Five protesters were arrested at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida and received one-year bans from the campus, local station WTXL reported, and two graduating seniors will not walk at their commencement ceremony due to their alleged actions in the demonstration. April 29A total of 13 protesters were arrested after about 200 people occupied Clio Hall at Princeton University in New Jersey, The Daily Princetonian reported. April 29Seventy-nine people were arrested at University of Texas-Austin after police clashed with protesters Monday, the university said in a statement, noting that 45 of the people arrested had “no affiliation” with the college. April 27Seventy-two people were arrested at Arizona State University’s encampment in Tempe and will be charged with trespassing, but only 15 were students at the university, the college said in a statement. April 25One-hundred eighteen students were arrested at Emerson University after the Boston Police Department raided their encampment—although the university sent staff to bail students out of jail and said it would “not bring any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.” April 25Twenty-eight people were arrested on Emory University’s campus, the school confirmed, including 20 students and faculty members—leading faculty members to call for a no-confidence vote in university president Gregory Fenves, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Although many universities seem to be cracking down on the protests, some have successfully negotiated with protesters and ended the encampments. Northwestern University signed a deal with its student protesters Monday, agreeing to disclose the university’s direct investments and reestablish an “Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility,” which will include students. The university also agreed to establish a house for Middle Eastern/North African students and will pay for five Palestinian students to attend the university next fall, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reported. In exchange, protesters agreed to dismantle all but one tent in the encampment—but the protest will remain permitted through June 1, the final day of classes. On Tuesday, Brown University’s encampment was also dismantled by protesters after the university agreed to meet with students on “divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.” The New York Police Department said late Thursday one of its officers accidentally fired his gun inside Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall while removing protestors from inside the administrative building on Tuesday night. No one was injured in the incident, reported first by the City, and it is being reviewed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. The NYPD said it has submitted body camera footage of the incident to the DA’s office. While the footage has not been made public, the protest group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday shared a video on X showing an NYPD officer at Columbia University texting “thought we fucking shot someone.” 2,200. That’s the number of people arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the Associated Press. A total of 56 arrest incidents linked to the protests have been reported across 43 different U.S. colleges or universities in that period, the report added. The massive pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses began after students at Columbia University created their first Gaza Solidarity Encampment on April 17 on the college’s lawn. Authorities at Columbia responded by calling in the NYPD, which arrested over 100 people and forcibly dismantled the camp. However, students began setting up a new encampment the next day. Encampments began popping up on other college campuses across the country, which met resistance from administrators and police. Several encampments are still ongoing, with protesters standing off against police and school authorities. In New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University postponed finals Thursday morning as protests continued on the campus lawn. A large protest encampment continues at Harvard University, as well, as finals week drags on at the elite college. Another protest is ongoing at George Washington University. Although Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously declined to clear out the encampment, House Republicans, including Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., visited the protest Wednesday and vowed to use their “legislative jurisdiction” over the nation’s capital to clamp down on the protests. Yemen’s Sanaa University criticized the police crackdown on students. The university is under the control of the Houthi militia, which was designated a terror group by the U.S. earlier this year. In a statement shared with Reuters, Sanaa University officials applauded the students for their “humanitarian” stance and even offered them admission. “We are serious about welcoming students that have been suspended from U.S. universities for supporting Palestinians...The board of the university condemns what academics and students of U.S. and European universities are being subjected to, suppression of freedom of expression,” a university official told Reuters.'}\n",

(Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) As has been my habit for a dozen years as a contributor at Forbes, it is time to conduct a midyear review of the annual energy predictions I made at the first of the current year in a piece titled “9 Consequential Energy Predictions For 2024.” It’s a little past time, actually, but a series of life events intervened. Better late than never. So, let’s just review those 9 predictions in the order they were made and see how we’re doing so far: The basic premise of this prediction was that legacy automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis would be forced by investor pressures to scale back and revise their EV development and production plans and goals. This certainly has happened so far in 2024, with the most consequential shifts coming at Ford. After suffering massive losses in the first quarter of 2024, Ford management announced it would delay billions of dollars in EV-related investments, along with plans to scale back plans to introduce new battery electric car models in favor of introducing a set of hybrid cars instead. GM has also moved to scale back and revise its own EV planning and production, and announced last month it was scaling back even more in response to slowing consumer demand for electric cars. For its own part, Stellantis announced layoffs of 400 workers in March as part of a cost-cutting program in its EV division and rolled out further cost-cutting measures last month. With consumer demand for EVs continuing to soften, we can expect these and other automakers to continue scaling down their plans and goals across the remainder of 2024. This headline is self-explanatory, and again, there is no doubt it has been accurate thus far in 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported in June that new additions of solar generation have not only outpaced wind growth in the first half of the current year, but solar has also grown faster than all other power generation sources. No surprises here. Despite the spending of trillions of dollars by OECD governments on subsidies for alternative generation sources over the last 30 years, the world used a record amount of coal during 2023. My prediction in January was that, despite predictions by the International Energy Agency and others that coal usage would reach a “peak” in 2024, global coal consumption would reach a new record high this year, driven mainly by demand growth in non-OECD nations like China, India, Indonesia and other developing nations. The jury remains out on this one, but stories about plans in both China and India for massive increases in their coal production, imports, and usage, along with rapidly rising global electricity needs due to AI and other factors indicates no such “peak” will be achieved anytime soon. This prediction was really low-hanging fruit, given that nations outside of North America and Europe have consistently prioritized energy security needs over climate goals. If anything, this is a trend that has only become stronger in 2024. As I noted in January’s piece, energy and energy policy have seldom risen a truly key issues in any presidential campaign. And, true to form, the moderators of the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden raised the topic only tangentially in a single question focused on climate change. We will have to wait and see how the post-party convention general election campaign plays out to know whether this prediction proves accurate. I still believe that will be the case. In its most recent monthly Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 2nd quarter global crude demand rise by 710,000 barrels per day year-over-year. But the IEA, OPEC, and other analysts have consistently expected 2024 demand growth to be stronger in the 2nd half of the year. If that proves to be the case, this prediction could turn out to have been accurate. We will have to wait and see. This one has been accurate so far, with the price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a high of $86.91 on April 5. The WTI price spent the first half of the year range-bound between $70 - $87 per barrel. With the global market for crude essentially in balance now and US producers still in a comfort zone in which strict capital discipline and growth through acquisitions are producing strong profitability, there is little reason to revise this prediction now. Due to the same factors cited above, this one has also turned out to be entirely accurate through the first half of the year. The Enverus Daily Rig Count shows that the number of US active drilling rigs stood at a modest 642 on January 1, and has fallen gradually to 627 as of this writing on July 16. The count reached a high of 670 on January 28 and saw a low of 610 on May 23. It is possible the industry is close to reaching a bottom in this count after 4 years of decline, so we could see a modest turnaround during the 3rd and 4th quarters. In January’s piece, I wrote that the “factors combining to moderate oil prices by raising supply will in turn result in consumer-pleasing moderation and consistency in prices for gasoline at the pump.” Again, this has turned out to be accurate over the first half of the year. Data published by Statista shows the US average price at the pump for regular grade gas stood at $3.07 on January 1, peaked at $3.68 in late April, and stood at $3.52 on July 15. So, no big spikes - just the normal ebbs and flows to be expected during a year in which global crude oil markets have remained unusually stable. The simplest way to summarize this mid-year assessment seems to come down to ‘so far, so good.’ But we cannot know what the next six months will bring. It’s a long time to December 31, and with a presidential election heating up, some of these predictions that look good right now could turn out otherwise when 2025 dawns.'}\n",

Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump appears during the Republican ... [+] National Convention Monday, July 15, 2024, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) A misty-eyed Trump entered the Fiserv Arena around 9 p.m. CT Monday with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear, taking his seat between his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Trump showed up before celebrity Amber Rose and Teamsters President Sean O’Brien delivered speeches. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., kicked off Monday’s speeches, both making anti-transgender statements in their brief remarks: Johnson said “biological males” should not be competing in women’s sports and denounced the “sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” and Greene said “let me state this clearly, there are only two genders.” Republicans officially nominated Trump on Monday afternoon, a formality as Trump won the majority of delegates in the primaries, clinching the nomination on March 12. Earlier Monday, Trump announced Vance as his running mate on Truth Social, and the GOP officially nominated him for the ticket later Monday. The former president is set to deliver a speech Thursday and Vance is scheduled to speak Wednesday. Monday’s speaker line-up also included former presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, Donalds, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Turning Point USA Executive Director Charlie Kirk. The events of each day center around a different theme; Monday’s is “Make America Wealthy Once Again.” Trump arrived in Milwaukee ahead of the convention Sunday. Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday he considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days following the attempt on his life, but ultimately decided to travel to Milwaukee as planned. “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he said. The convention comes just two days after Trump narrowly avoided assassination when a gunman opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s right ear with a bullet and killing an audience member. The shooting has injected a rare theme of unity between Republicans and Democrats into the 2024 presidential campaign as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned political violence in the wake of the attack. Trump enters the convention as the vast majority of polls taken in the wake of his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden show him expanding his lead over the president and as Biden faces calls from within his own party to step aside in the race. In a victory for Trump on Monday, Florida-based federal Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him, ruling the agency violated the Constitution by appointing special prosecutor Jack Smith to handle the case without the approval of Congress or the president.

      "{'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/woodmackenzie/2024/06/11/how-november-election-results-could-slow-down-the-us-energy-transition/', 'title': 'How November Election Results Could Slow Down The US Energy Transition', 'date': 'Jun 11, 2024,02:15pm EDT', 'author': 'Wood Mackenzie', 'content': 'With increased support for low-carbon energy in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022, Wood Mackenzie’s base case for the US projects that by 2050, wind and solar power capacity will expand sixfold and low carbon hydrogen will account for 5% of the energy mix. It also shows that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. But possibilities exist that it might not work out that way. Here are some reasons why:   Wood Mackenzie’s latest delayed energy transition scenario for the US looks at critical areas that could be affected. Below, are answers to five key questions that decision-makers will face before and after the election results are known. In a delayed transition scenario, is peak fossil fuel demand off the table? Peak fossil fuel demand will be delayed, not eliminated. With a higher demand outlook, our delayed transition scenario calls for US$154 billion more in US upstream oil and gas capital investment compared to our base case over 2023-2050. While electrification of energy is lower than our base case, power demand still increases 45% from 2030-2050. In our delayed transition scenario, peak fossil fuel demand comes around 10 years later than our base case, but the peak is still coming. Facing peak demand, low-carbon investments by the US oil and gas sector are still needed to build resilient business models. Diversifying business models will require policy support and we do not expect a repeal of the IRA even in a delayed transition scenario. The benefits of the IRA are widely spread across the US, underpinning bi-partisan support. A vote to end provisions such as Production and Investment Tax credits, while not impossible, is unlikely. Are the latest tariffs on renewables part of a delayed transition scenario? Yes, but tariffs are one of many variables that could slow down investment. A second Trump Presidency will slow down policy support for electrification, new technologies and grid expansions. Key programs at risk in our delayed transition scenario include the US$8.8 billion for residential electrification and efficiency rebates, the US$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Program. Other power market reforms stall in our delayed transition scenario. FERC Order 1920, designed to jump start investment in cross state power infrastructure, would have a limited impact due to the cost sharing challenges across states. Reforms to generator interconnection queues fail to clear current backlogs and interconnection delays impede the growth of new renewable generation. Infrastructure permitting reform remains limited. Harmonizing local, state and federal permitting proves to be an insurmountable challenge. How will industrial re-shoring and AI impact power demand? In April 2024, manufacturing investments in the US reached US$228 billion–materially higher than the annual average of US$80\\u202fbillion over the last decade–according to the US Census Bureau. Data center investment, especially in Northern Virginia, is picking up and will act as another tailwind to power demand growth. Load growth will accelerate, but it may not be as fast as you think. In our delayed transition scenario, we project that industrial load growth will not be explosive or linear. We expect an s-curve profile. It will take time for new data center loads to connect to the grid, find appropriate sites and secure backup power generation. Once major roadblocks are addressed, it’s possible that demand growth will outpace historical demand elasticities through the late 2020s and 2030s. Long-term efficiency gains in computing power will reduce load growth from 2040 onwards. What is the future for low-carbon hydrogen in a delayed transition scenario? In our delayed transition scenario, electrolytic hydrogen faces an uphill battle. We assume the rules for eligibility for tax credits under the IRA would be adjusted to favor blue hydrogen. Two options available to the US Treasury Department could advantage blue hydrogen. Firstly, allowing individual blue hydrogen projects to use reported carbon intensities of gas feedstock rather than national average intensities would help them claim the full 45V tax credit. Secondly, permitting the use of renewable natural gas as a feedstock with source-specific carbon intensities would also support project economics for blue hydrogen producers. What is the lower boundary on EV deployment and the impact on metals? Our delayed transition scenario expects EV stock to be around 50% lower than our base case. The key variables in the outlook for EVs are new car sales and potential policy changes under a Trump\\u202fadministration. So far this year, sales of hybrids have leapt 57%, while EV sales have undershot expectations, growing by only 19%. Weakening federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel economy standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe would likely lead to automakers increasing investment in hybrids to meet consumer demand while complying with federal emissions targets. In our delayed transition scenario, automakers would increasingly shift EV batteries from high-cost metals such as cobalt to lower-cost iron-based chemistries. US battery raw material demand for key metals would be about 27% lower than in our base case, easing supply chain stress and the US’ reliance on China.'}\n"
